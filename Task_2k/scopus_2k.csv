Shipments of essential and life-saving products, ranging from pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and healthcare, to manufacturing, have been significantly impacted or delayed, making the global SCs vulnerable. A better understanding of the shipment risks can substantially reduce that nervousness. Thenceforth, this paper proposes a few Deep Learning (DL) approaches to mitigate shipment risks by predicting ”if a shipment can be exported from one source to another”, despite the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed DL methodologies have four main stages: data capturing, de-noising or pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. The feature extraction stage depends on two main variants of DL models. The first variant involves three recurrent neural networks (RNN) structures (i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU)), and the second variant is the temporal convolutional network (TCN). In terms of the classification stage, six different classifiers are applied to test the entire methodology. These classifiers are SoftMax, random trees (RT), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). The performance of the proposed DL models is evaluated based on an online dataset (taken as a case study). The numerical results show that one of the proposed models (i.e., TCN) is about 100% accurate in predicting the risk of shipment to a particular destination under COVID-19 restrictions. Unarguably, the aftermath of this work will help the decision-makers to predict supply chain risks proactively to increase the resiliency of the SCs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",""Classifiers"; Convolutional network; COVID-19; Deep learning; Supply chain risk;" Temporal convolutional network"",""Brain"; Convolution; Decision trees; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Nearest neighbor search; Ships; Supply chains; Support vector machines; Convolutional networks; Data capturing; De-noising; Deep learning; Global supply chain; Learning approach; Learning models; Supply-chain risks; Temporal convolutional network;" COVID-19""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper proposes an optimization algorithm of overseas surgical warehouse location in the cross-border medical supply chain network based on parallel big data mining. Taking the overseas warehouse location problem of cross-border e-commerce enterprises as the research background, the paper establishes an overseas warehouse with parallel big data mining technology in the case of domestic supply points determined, so as to meet the demand of the overseas market for distribution services. According to the cross-border transportation cost, local transportation cost, and warehouse building operation cost, the total logistics cost of overseas warehouse mode is composed"; the actual demand of overseas warehouse location is analyzed; and the market value is introduced into the decision-making of overseas warehouse location. Through the preliminary analysis of the factors affecting the market value, combined with the level analysis method, the market-value evaluation system of demand area is constructed, and the market value right of each demand area is calculated. By introducing the concept of time window, the customer satisfaction function is established based on whether the delivery time meets the customer's psychological expectation;" by introducing market value and customer satisfaction, the multi-objective location model of customer satisfaction considering cost and market value is established. The improved particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to the multi-objective model to solve the multi-objective location problem with constraints, so as to obtain a higher market share and determine the best location. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve user satisfaction and optimal probability and reduce the lowest cost of the system.

In the early weeks following the COVID-19 pandemic, 20–30% reduction in blood donation had observed, which adversely affected the whole blood supply chain. Although this shortage was partially compensated through rescheduling of elective surgeries and shifting some inpatient surgeries to outpatient surgeries, resumption of the normal surgeries by hospitals had increased the demands for the blood products. At the same time, the total blood supply was increased by some measures taken to overcome the blood shortage. In this paper, a multivariate time-series deep learning model based on long short-term memory is proposed to forecast the blood donation/demand. It takes daily time-series of blood donation/demand (internal features) as well as daily time-series of new confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths (external features) as its inputs, and predicts blood donation/demand for the next week. The proposed model is used to achieve a resilient blood inventory management, capable of handling the uncertainties occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed blood donation/demand forecasting model has been successfully simulated on the collected data of Tehran Blood Center in Tehran, Iran, for a time period from February 24, 2020, to October 14, 2021. Obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed model by obtaining 6.1% and 6.5% error between the actual and forecasted values of the number of donations and demands, respectively. The results of applying the proposed model for inventory management of blood platelets demonstrate the resiliency of our model to reduce shortage and wastage rates against the existing uncertainty handling models by 32.1% and 26.6%, respectively. The proposed method can be used to assist the decision makers in managing the blood supply chains through prioritizing the blood transfusions during COVID-19 and similar pandemics in the future. © 2022 The Author(s)"",""Blood supply chain"; COVID-19; Inventory management; Long short-term memory;" Multivariate time-series forecasting"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, it is pretty challenging to develop an efficient financial supply chain for Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) by providing credits and services. In this research, an FSC model analyzes by emphasizing the retailer and supplier relationship. The retailer predicts the market demand to maximize profit, and accordingly, orders to the suppliers and suppliers utilize the production capabilities in limited monetary value. In such a case, the supplier also needs to apply for loans to meet the production commitment. With an intelligent lending platform, applicants can get loans quickly and more conveniently from the lenders. Still, identifying defaulter borrowers is a difficult task on the peer-to-peer lending platform. The main focus of the lenders is to maximize profit and minimize risk by giving the loan to non-defaulter suppliers. The present study describes the importance of the financial parameters (λ) of the retailers and suppliers (MSMEs) and their impact on the related supply chain. We provide the proof of dependency of the financial parameter on the cost of debt and the ratio of the debt-to-equity by developing two propositions. We propose an innovative k-Random Boosting Classifiers (k-RBC) algorithm for identifying potential good and bad borrowers to capture this case. The time complexity of the k-RBC algorithm is O(n2log(n)). The results obtained from the study show a significant improvement in comparison to the outputs from existing approaches on the same datasets.

The purchase price of the product is assumed to be age dependent, and the age distribution of the product is assumed to be known and is shared among all the supply chain members. Each agent representing a regional hospital or the central warehouse in the supply chain replenishes its stocks from its upstream agent. In IIM approaches, reinforcement learning methods, specifically Q-learning and Deep Q-network, are used to construct inventory policies. The IIM policies provide hospitals with near-optimal order quantities and remaining life distributions for products they order. Through many test instances, the performance of the IIM policies is compared to that of periodic review (R,s,S) policies obtained through a stochastic mixed integer programming model, solved using CPLEX and a genetic algorithm. The computational results demonstrate that the IIM policies are more cost-effective than the R,s,S policies, although the genetic algorithm has a speed advantage. Moreover, as compared with the R,s,S polices, the IIM polices have a lower possibility of product shortage, and thereby a higher service level for the patients, and a lower risk of product expiration. By implementing the IIM approaches, a healthcare system may also save storage space, in addition to having a lower total inventory cost.

Our results show that under reselling structure, when platform innovation is as efficient as manufacturer innovation, manufacturer innovation achieves higher profit for both supply chain players, which implies that policy makers can encourage manufacturer innovation by providing incentive mechanisms. Whereas under agency selling, the impact of innovation efficiency on firms’ profit depends on the platform's commission rate. Moreover, the manufacturer is more likely to benefit from platform innovation than the electronic retailer, and the electronic retailer is better off under agency selling. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",""Electronic retailing"; Game theory; Supply chain management;" Technology innovation"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper presents the bases of an integrated Decision Support System (DSS) for planning the operations of three successive echelons in the fertilizer part of a phosphate supply chain working in pull mode: production, vessel loading and storage where storage cannot constitute a decoupling point. Considering the whole perimeter of these planning operations within a monolithic optimization problem is much too huge to be solvable. Thus, the proposed DSS encapsulates an existing production scheduling model, an existing berth scheduling model, and a new model for the Storage Space Allocation Problem (SSAP). The latter provides a precise allocation of storage spaces for the fertilizers entering and leaving the hangars. Therefore, the proposed DSS aims to align production and storage decisions with vessel demands in a lean perspective, ensuring consistency in decision-making and keeping, if possible, the optimal solutions of production and port models. This approach is illustrated by several tests inspired by actual data provided by OCP Group on its operations at the Jorf Lasfar chemical platform in Morocco, but it is also valid for any other phosphate fertilizer producer that ships fertilizers in large batches from storage spaces directly linked to a fertilizer plant. This research yields several academic contributions in lean supply chain management and provides an original approach for modeling time in the SSAP. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."",""Berth scheduling"; Bulk ports; Decision support system; Integrated planning; Production scheduling;" Storage space allocation"",""Artificial intelligence"; Decision making; Digital storage; Production control; Scheduling; Supply chain management; Berth scheduling; Bulk port; Integrated decision; Integrated planning; Port operations; Production Scheduling; Scheduling models; Storage space allocation problem; Storage space allocations; Storage spaces;" Decision support systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Design/methodology/approach: Using a systematic literature review methodology, this study analyzes the publications available on Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar that linked both AI and supply chain from one side and ML and supply chain from another side. A total of 388 research studies have been identified through the before said three database searches which are further screened, sorted and finalized with 50 studies. The research thoroughly reviews and analyzes the final lists of 50 studies that were found relevant and significant to the theme of AI and ML in supply chain management (SCM). Findings: AI and ML applications are still at the infant stage and the opportunity for them to elevate supply chain performance is very promising. Some researchers developed AI and ML-related models which were tested and proved to be effective in optimizing SC, and therefore, the application of AI and ML in supply chain networks creates competitive advantages for firms. Other researchers claim that AI and ML are both currently adding value while many other researchers believe that they are still not fully exploited and their tools and techniques can leverage the supply chain’s total value. The research found that adoption of AI and ML have the ability to reduce the bullwhip effect, and therefore, further supports the performance of supply chain efficiency and responsiveness. Research limitations/implications: This research was limited in terms of scope as it covered AI and ML applications in the supply chain while there are other dimensions that could be investigated such as big data and robotics but it was found too lengthy to include these additional dimensions, and therefore, left for future research studies that other researchers could explore and pursue. Practical implications: This study opens the door wide for other researchers to explore how AI and ML can be adopted in SCM and what are the models that are already tested and proven to be viable. In addition, the paper also identified a group of research studies that confirmed the unexploited avenues of AI and ML which could be of high interest to other researchers to explore. Originality/value: Although few earlier research studies touch based on the AI applications within manufacturing and transportation, this study is different and makes a unique contribution by offering a holistic view on the AI and ML implications within SC as a whole.

The ethical language associated with food supply and technology is contextualised and framed by the meaning given to it by stakeholders. Failure to differentiate between these nuanced meanings can create a barrier to technology adoption and reduce the benefit derived. Scope and approach: The aim of this review paper is to consider the embedded ethical language used by stakeholders who collaborate in the adoption of AI in food supply chains. Ethical perspectives frame this literature review and provide structure to consider how to shape a common discourse to build trust in, and frame more considered utilisation of, AI in food supply chains to the benefit of users, and wider society. Key findings and conclusions: Whilst the nature of data within the food system is much broader than the personal data covered by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the ethical issues for computational and AI systems are similar and can be considered in terms of particular aspects: transparency, traceability, explainability, interpretability, accessibility, accountability and responsibility. The outputs of this research assist in giving a more rounded understanding of the language used, exploring the ethical interaction of aspects of AI used in food supply chains and also the management activities and actions that can be adopted to improve the applicability of AI technology, increase engagement and derive greater performance benefits.

Its sheer numbers, together with social and environmental sustainability concerns, and the move towards digitalization of customer-centric operations, make the fashion business a prime target for Decision Support Systems (DSSs). On the other hand, decision support in fashion retail is particularly problematic and embraces all major supply chain domains. Decisions in an online fashion retail supply chain (FRSC) are highly dependent on time-varying customers' preferences and product availability, often leading to a combinatorial explosion. To address such a problem, DSSs could greatly benefit from high-quality information stored in customer models (CMs), constructed by using Artificial Intelligence techniques, allowing informed decisions on how to personalize (adapt) to match the customer's needs and preferences. Combinations of CMs with recommender systems (RSs) have been increasingly utilized in fashion e-commerce to provide personalized product recommendations. Nevertheless, works on enhancing CMs for e-commerce or other decision-making chain domains are scanty. This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on fashion CMs with applications to decision-making in FRSCs, mining topics for a research agenda.

Among the researchers, there has been a significant focus on identifying, mitigating, and managing the risks that affect the supply chain (SC). Though the research on SCRM remains for an extended period, still the industries are facing difficulties in managing the SC risks. Also, the SC managers have begun to focus on decision-making based on numerous data sources for predicting the uncertainties more accurately to achieve a proactive and predictive intelligent risk management mechanism. These attributes make Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) suitable techniques in the SCRM field. The application of these techniques in SCRM is in a nascent stage. In this view, this paper presents a systematic and descriptive review of the literature and identifies the various AI and ML methods applied in different phases related to SCRM. Also, it investigates the different categories of SC risks and the existing articles based on the AI technique used. This analysis focuses on research articles related to SCRM from three scientific databases published between 2010 and 2021 for detailed study. Finally, this review provides unexplored and missing aspects in current research, challenges on implementing AI technologies, and describes promising avenues for the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",""Artificial intelligence"; Machine learning; Proactive decision-making;" Risk management"",""Machine learning"; Risk assessment; Risk management; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Data-source; Decisions makings; Intelligent risk management; Management IS; Management mechanisms; Proactive decision-making; Risks management; Supply-chain risks; Systematic Review; Uncertainty;" Decision making""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This new generation of brand development has brought an era of hyper-customized experiences to benefit brand performance. With the Branding 4.0 literature still in its infancy, questions remain regarding how brands can maintain their identity while delivering a hyper-personalized customer experience. This study draws on mass customization, artificial intelligence, and supply chain management literature to investigate how three core organizational capabilities and resources—machine learning, modularity, and supply chain integration—helpful in achieving production flexibility could jointly enable companies to transition to and maintain a Branding 4.0 philosophy through more efficient personalization of their product offerings. This paper reports findings from 15 in-depth interviews with top executives from brands, including some Fortune Global 500 companies, in China's garment and footwear industries to provide insights into Branding 4.0 and the possible contribution of machine learning, modularity application, and supply chain integration. Our findings inform a two-tier response strategy and a three-dimensional analytical framework which provide a theoretical basis for operationalizing Branding 4.0 and exploring, through a resource orchestration lens, how brands can respond to the related adoption challenges. Specifically, our findings show how machine learning's data analysis, knowledge conversion, and transmission capabilities could benefit both modular management and supply chain tasks to optimize product co-design processes and timely responses to customers' changing demands. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."",""Branding 4.0"; Machine learning; Process modularity; Product modularity;" Supply chain integration"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Digital technologies are expected to foster information exchange and facilitate collaboration on sustainability issues between firms. Yet, there is limited empirical evidence explaining the role of Industry 4.0 in the context of sustainable supply chain management. This qualitative, exploratory study examines digitalisation in the electronics supply chain and its implications for sustainable supply chain collaboration (SCC). We focus on environmental sustainability aspects, such as environmental data analysis and energy use in the supply chain. We conducted 18 interviews with representatives from international electronics buying firms and Chinese suppliers to explore a) how digital technologies are currently used in SCC, and b) which opportunities, risks, and obstacles are associated with digitalisation in sustainable SCC. Our results indicate that a broad range of digital technologies on different digital maturity levels (including Industry 4.0 technologies) are used in SCC, but their use for sustainability purposes is still underdeveloped. Digitalisation is expected by most firms to improve sustainability, e.g., using big data analytics for energy management or easing the transfer of sustainability knowledge in the chain (what we call """"digital environmental upgrading""""). We argue, however, that if firms do not prioritise addressing sustainability through digitalisation in collaboration, digitalisation-related sustainability potentials will either not materialise on the firm-level, e.g., due to data sharing concerns, or will tend to be overshadowed by the negative indirect effects of digitalisation, such as rebound effects.

For the long-term evaluation of this creative sector, numerous intricate sustainability components, such as environmental, social, and financial, are necessary. The study focuses on long-term sustainability considerations in the supply chain in the construction sector. This work aims to address this information and examine sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research in the construction sector in this manner. More than 95 publications were studied from the beginning of 2017 to the end of 2021 using both in-depth content analysis and bibliometric methodologies. Several issues of SSCM in construction have been found including environmental, economic and social patterns which are most commonly known as the triple bottom line, typically enhanced by artificial intelligence. Many challenges were discovered including inefficiencies in the logistics system and a shortage of funding, environmental issues in demolition procedures and difficulties in applying sustainability measures due to high skill, data, and time requirements. The article offers a broad list of potentials for improving the current situation in the construction sector by using various types of supply chains such as increasing investment in energy conservation and emission reduction technologies to drive sustainable development, establishing strong green supply chain relationships, and forming a Covid-19 financial support group for small construction companies among other things. The study’s findings suggested that due to the significance of long-term relationships between construction companies, suppliers and customers, smart technology could make it simpler to reach every supply chain link.

GSCI is evolving as a new paradigm of green supply chain management (GSCM) to elevate its five underlying implementation dimensions. Manufacturing enterprises can benefit from digital technology applications to enhance efficiency of environmental outcomes of their GSCM activities, including internal environmental management, green purchasing, customer cooperation, inventory recovery, and eco-design.

While the role of safety stocks in coping with uncertainty is well studied, safety time has received only scarce attention in the supply chain management literature. Particularly, most previous operations research models have typically considered the use of such inventory buffers in a separate fashion, but not together. Here, we propose a decision support system (DSS) to address the problem of integrating optimal safety stock and safety time decisions at the component level, in multi-supplier multi-item single-stage industrial supply chains under dynamic demands and stochastic lead times. The DSS is based on a hybrid bi-objective optimization approach that simultaneously optimizes upstream inventory holding costs and β-service levels, suggesting multiple non-dominated Pareto-optimal solutions to decision-makers. We further explore a weighted closed-form analytical expression to select a single Pareto-optimal point from a set of non-dominated solutions, thereby enhancing the practical application of the proposed DSS. We describe the implementation of our approach in a major automotive electronics company operating under a myriad of components with dynamic demand, uncertain supply and requirements plans with different degrees of sparsity. We show the potential of our approach to improve β-service levels while minimizing inventory-related costs. The results suggest that, in certain cases, it appears to be more cost-effective to combine safety stock with safety time compared to considering each inventory buffer independently. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",""Decision support"; Multi-objective optimization; Safety stock;" Safety time"",""Accident prevention"; Artificial intelligence; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Multiobjective optimization; Operations research; Pareto principle; Stochastic systems; Supply chain management; Bi-objective optimization; Decision supports; Industrial supply chains; Inventory buffer; Multi-item; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization approach; Safety stock; Safety time; Single stage;" Decision support systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We used “affordance theory” to study how managers perceive emerging technologies to explain their adoption experience. Affordance theory indicates that perceived benefits—and goals and constraints—depend on the interaction between technology and the users, not on the technology alone. First, we used the literature for two purposes: first, to obtain characteristics of blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) as emerging technologies";" and second, to itemize generic goals, affordances, and constraints in adopting any supply chain technology. Next, we asked 400+ supply chain managers to select those affordances, constraints, and goals that they viewed as pertinent to their organizations’ supply chains for whichever of these three technologies they were implementing. Finally, we compared the responses across technologies for individual respondents (who selected more than one technology) and within the pool of respondents. We found that respondents who selected more than one technology made distinct selections individually for the different technologies relevant to them. The pooled responses across all respondents, however, prioritized the aggregated goals, affordances, and constraints in the same way, regardless of the technology, the organization, or the network features of the supply chain. Overall, it appears that the characteristics of the technology do not inform user expectations at the early stages of adoption. This initial disconnect—between characteristics and expectation—may explain the “inflated expectations” followed by the early “trough of disappointment” with emerging technologies in the Gartner Hype Cycle, as users focus on obtaining the same benefits for the supply chain from any new emerging technology. Only subsequent shared experiences can lead to the long “slope of enlightenment.”. © 2022 The Authors.

Using dynamic unsupervised anomaly detection models, anomalies were detected in indicator data expected by domain experts to impact the development of food safety risks in milk. Additionally, a Bayesian network was used to identify the chemical food safety hazards in milk associated with an anomaly for the Netherlands. The results showed that the frequency of anomalies varied per country and indicator. However, all countries showed in the period investigated (2008–2019), anomalies in the indicators “raw milk price” and “barely milk price” and no anomalies in the indicator” income of dairy farms”. A cross-correlation analysis of the number of Rapid Alert for Food and Feed (RASFF) notifications and anomalies in indicators revealed significant correlations of many indicators but difference between countries was observed. Interesting, for all countries the cross corelation with indicator “milk price” was significant, albeit the lag time varied from 5 months (United Kingdom) to 22 months (Italy). This finding suggests that severe changes in domains adjacent to the food supply chain may trigger the development of food safety problems that become visible many months later. Awareness of such relationships will provide the opportunity for food producers or inspectors to take timely measures to prevent food safety problems. © 2022 The Authors"",""Anomaly detection"; Bayesian network; Detrended cross-correlation analysis; Dynamic unsupervised anomaly detection; Emerging risk;" Milk safety"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

COVID-19 has led to a long-term strain on the healthcare supply chain (HCSC) and has resulted in a lack of basic healthcare necessities. It has become apparent that supply chain disruptions and increased usage has led to a lack of medical supplies needed to provide the proper care to patients. Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) will help to indicate what characteristics contribute to resilient healthcare supply chains. To assess the characteristic of a resilient supply chain, significant healthcare supply chains will help indicate significant characteristics. A case study on the medical supplies’ supply chains is presented. A rank reversal proximity index MCDM method ranks criteria to assist with decision making. The proximity index will reduce the chances of the rank reversal phenomenon that results in incorrect rankings from occurring. Results show that redundancy, collaboration, and robustness are key indicators of a resilient supply chain while, supply chain design, communication capabilities, and supply chain risk management become comparatively less important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, an unsupervised machine learning tecnique named “cluster analysis” is conducted to group the resilience indicators of the respective supply chain. Through this study, the best way to combat disruptions in the healthcare supply chain due to large-scale pandemics is to share information quickly, reduce reliance on the design of the supply chain, and track the usage of necessary medical supplies. Alternatively, we validated our study by comparing a Preference Selection Index (PSI) to the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"",""Cluster analysis"; COVID-19; Healthcare supply chain; Preference Selection Index (PSI); Proximity Indexed Value (PIV); Rank reversal; Resilience;" Unsupervised machine learining"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There has been a growing interest among researchers to investigate the resiliency in supply chain operations to overcome risks and disruptions and to achieve successful project management. The supply chain of every business requires innovative projects to accomplish competitive advantage in the market. This study was conducted to identify the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) for creating a sustainable and resilient supply chain, and also to provide optimum solutions for supply chain risk mitigation. A systematic literature review has been conducted to examine the potential research contribution or directions in the field of AI and SCR. In total, 162 articles were shortlisted from the SCOPUS database in the chosen field of research. Structural Topic Modeling (STM), a big data-based approach, was employed to generate several thematic topics of AI in SCR based on the shortlisted articles, and all topics were discussed. Furthermore, the bibliometric analysis was conducted using R-package to investigate the research trends in the area of AI in SCR. Based on the conducted review of literature, a research framework was proposed for AI in SCR that will facilitate researchers and practitioners to improve technological development in supply chain firms. The purpose is to combat sudden risks and disruptions so that project management will perform well Post COVID-19. The study will be also helpful for future researchers and practitioners to identify research directions based on existing literature covered in this paper in the field of SCR.

The multiobjective supply chain configuration (MOSCC) in SCM is to set the optimal configurations for supply chain members to minimize both the cost of goods sold ( CoGS ) and the lead time ( LT ). Although some algorithms have been proposed for the MOSCC, they do not make the best use of the problem-related knowledge and cannot perform well on the large-scale instances with many members and configuration options. Therefore, this article proposes a multipopulation ant colony system with knowledge-based local searches (MPACS-KLSs). First, the multiobjective algorithm is based on the multiple populations for multiple objectives framework. Two ant colonies are used to separately minimize CoGS and LT , which helps to search in the biobjective space sufficiently. Second, with the considerations of the problem-related knowledge, a priority-based solution construction method, a rank-based heuristic strategy, and an objective-oriented global pheromone updating strategy are proposed. Third, to speed up the convergence, especially for large-scale MOSCC instances, two knowledge-based local searches are designed to minimize CoGS and LT of solutions, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted on both the instances from the real life and the randomly generated instances with different problem scales. The results show that MPACS-KLS is superior to the contestant algorithms, especially on the large-scale MOSCC instances, which significantly extends the AI and optimization techniques in practical applications of the smart city. © 1997-2012 IEEE."",""Ant colony system (ACS)"; knowledge-based local searches (KLSs); multiobjective optimization; multiple populations for multiple objectives (MPMOs); smart city;" supply chain configuration (SCC)"",""Ant colony optimization"; Artificial intelligence; Heuristic methods; Smart city; Supply chain management; Configuration options; Construction method; Multi objective algorithm; Multiple populations; Multiple-objectives; Optimization techniques; Supply chain configuration; Supply chain managements (SCM);" Knowledge based systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To improve the economic and green benefits of enterprises, the BPNN algorithm is applied to the green supply chain assisted by intelligent logistics robots. The BPNN algorithm can be used to output the characteristics of different information and optimize the green supply chain according to the input parameters and the influencing factors in the network. Firstly, an evaluation index system is established for selecting suppliers, which includes 4 first-level indicators: operational indicators, economic indicators, green indicators, social indicators, and 14 corresponding secondary indicators. Secondly, the evaluation indicator system is modeled through the BPNN. Finally, using the BPNN model, a supply chain enterprise's selection of cooperative enterprises in Xi'an is taken as the research object and simulation. Finally, the output results of the five alternative enterprises are 0.77, 0.75, 0.68, 0.72, and 0.65, respectively. The enterprise with the highest output results is selected as the cooperative enterprise and the enterprise with the second highest output results as an alternate.

One of the most pressing problems nowadays is the provenance of food and food-related products that citizens consume, mainly due to several food scares and the globalization of food markets, which has resulted in food supply chains that extend beyond nations or even continent boundaries. Food supply networks are characterized by high complexity and a lack of openness. There is a critical requirement for applying novel techniques to verify and authenticate the origin, quality parameters, and transfer/storage details associated with food. This study portrays an end-to-end approach to enhance the security of the food supply chain and thus increase the trustfulness of the food industry. The system aims at increasing the transparency of food supply chain monitoring systems through securing all components that those consist of. A universal information monitoring scheme based on blockchain technology ensures the integrity of collected data, a self-sovereign identity approach for all supply chain actors ensures the minimization of single points of failure, and finally, a security mechanism, that is based on the use of TinyML’s nascent technology, is embedded in monitoring devices to mitigate a significant portion of malicious behavior from actors in the supply chain. © 2022 by the authors.

While these approaches in general prove to solve the disruption problem, they come with a negative effect on cost per product and cost of capital. In a highly volatile demand environment with fast pace changing technology, increasing inventory can constitute a big risk for obsolesce, hence additional measures are needed to create a competitive business advantage with such a supply chain. Furthermore, when competing about the same sources, as in the case of semiconductors, Operations Executives need to be able to respond fast when supply issues occur, in order to minimize the potential impact from a disruption. The ability to react and response to a disruption is enhanced with Supply chain risk tools utilizing the most recent technologies, such as Control Tower solutions enabling End-to End monitoring and transparency. However, even with the help of such technology, the decision maker will still be reactive and can merely respond to occurrences. To reach the next level of responsiveness, additional layer of intelligence is needed in the supply chain solution. From the available literature about Supply Chain Resilience, and similar advanced supply chain solutions, we can conclude that the main focus of research has so far been on the demand side, i.e., how to enhance forecast management. There are thus few practical and academic contributions on how to manage the supply side or more precise on how to manage the Inbound Supply Chain in a volatile business environment.

Despite the current fast digital technologies, customers expect the ordering and delivery process to be faster, and as a result, this has made it easier and more efficient for organizations looking to implement new technologies. “Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)”, which means using the Internet of Things to perform intelligent tasks with the help of artificial intelligence integration, is one of these expected innovations that can turn a complex supply chain into an integrated process. AIoT innovations such as data sensors and RFID (radio detection technology), with the power of artificial intelligence analysis, provide information to implement features such as tracking and instant alerts to improve decision making. Such data can become vital information to help improve operations and tasks. However, the same evolving technology with the presence of the Internet and the huge amount of data can pose many challenges for the supply chain and the factors involved. In this study, by conducting a literature review and interviewing experts active in FMCG industries as an available case study, the most important challenges facing the AIoT-powered supply chain were extracted. By examining these challenges using nonlinear quantitative analysis, the importance of these challenges was examined and their causal relationships were identified. The results showed that cybersecurity and a lack of proper infrastructure are the most important challenges facing the AIoT-based supply chain. © 2022 by the authors.

As a result, demand forecasting as well as the task of predictive analysis, holds a great attention in the supply chain, in order to meet the needs of customers, avoid any out of stock, and at the same time avoid a waste of resources. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method based on long-term memory multilayer networks (LSTM) for demand forecasting. Using the grid search method, our method has the ability to automatically select the most optimal forecasting model, considering different combinations of LSTM hyperparameters of a time series. The proposed model has shown strength in capturing the existing nonlinear features in time series data compared to some known time series forecasting methods derived from statistical and machine learning approaches, using historical sales data of a Moroccan pharmaceutical manufacturing company. These methods include exponential smoothing (ETS), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), recurrent neural network (RNN). The evaluation of the proposed method and the comparison methods was performed using the root mean square error (RMSE) and Symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE).

Credit ratings, as an approximate but important measure of corporate credit risks, have been widely used by investors, creditors, and supply chain partners in their decision-making. This study studies the role of supply chain information in predicting companies’ credit ratings. Using firm-level supplier–customer linkages and corporate credit rating data, we develop a machine learning framework with gradient boosted decision trees to examine whether and what supply chain features can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of credit ratings, and what types of supply chain links have higher information content that positively affects the predictability of the supply chain features. We construct a firm's supply chain variables from its supplier and customer portfolios. We show that incorporating supply chain features can improve prediction accuracy over the benchmark credit rating model using only the focal firm's features. Moreover, the informativeness of supply chain links in focal credit risk prediction depends on the focal firm's industry sector, the relationship strength of such links, and the switching costs. Finally, we develop a focal credit rating prediction model with a high accuracy level using supply chain factors solely, which can potentially be applied to predict credit risks of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and private firms with no public financial information, as long as their supply chain information is available. © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society."",""credit rating"; credit risk; machine learning application;" supply chains"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This research, therefore, contributes to filling the gap by carrying out an SLR of contemporary research studies in the area of RFID applications in supply chains. To date, SLR augmented with BA has not been used to study the developments in RFID applications in supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: We analyze 556 articles from years 2001 to date using Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Contemporary bibliometric analysis (BA) tools are utilized. First, an exploratory analysis is carried, out revealing influential authors, sources, regions, among other key aspects. Second, a co-citation work analysis is utilized to understand the conceptual structure of the literature, followed by a dynamic co-citation network to reveal the evolution of the field. This is followed by a multivariate analysis is performed on top-100 cited papers, and k-means clustering is carried out to find optimal groups and identify research themes. The influential themes are then pointed out using factor analysis. Findings: An exploratory analysis is carried out using BA tools to provide insights into factors such as influential authors, production countries, top-cited papers and frequent keywords. Visualization of bibliographical data using co-citation network analysis and keyword co-occurrence analysis assisted in understanding the groups (communities) of research themes. We employed k-means clustering and factor analysis methods to further develop these insights. A historiographical direct citation analysis also unveils potential research directions. We observe that RFID applications in the supply chain are likely to benefit from the Internet of Things and blockchain Technology along with the other machine learning and visualization approaches. Originality/value: Although several researchers have researched RFID literature in relation to supply chains, these reviews are often conducted in the traditional manner where the author(s) select paper based on their area of expertise, interest and experience. Limitation of such reviews includes authors’ selection bias of studies to be included and limited or no use of advanced BA tools for analysis. This study fills this research gap by conducting an SLR of RFID in supply chains to identify important research trends in this field through the use of advanced BA tools. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""Bibliometric analysis"; Clustering; Cocitation analysis; Factor analysis; Multivariate analysis; Network analysis; RFID; Supply chain;" Systematic literature review"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Considering the availability of data and the huge number of supply chains that had their weak links exposed during COVID-19, the objective of the study is to employ artificial intelligence to develop supply chain resilience to withstand extreme disruptions such as COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: We adopted a qualitative approach for interviewing respondents using a semi-structured interview schedule through the lens of organisational information processing theory. A total of 31 respondents from the supply chain and information systems field shared their views on employing artificial intelligence (AI) for supply chain resilience during COVID-19. We used a process of open, axial and selective coding to extract interrelated themes and proposals that resulted in the establishment of our framework. Findings: An AI-facilitated supply chain helps systematically develop resilience in its structure and network. Resilient supply chains in dynamic settings and during extreme disruption scenarios are capable of recognising (sensing risks, degree of localisation, failure modes and data trends), analysing (what-if scenarios, realistic customer demand, stress test simulation and constraints), reconfiguring (automation, re-alignment of a network, tracking effort, physical security threats and control) and activating (establishing operating rules, contingency management, managing demand volatility and mitigating supply chain shock) operations quickly. Research limitations/implications: As the present research was conducted through semi-structured qualitative interviews to understand the role of AI in supply chain resilience during COVID-19, the respondents may have an inclination towards a specific role of AI due to their limited exposure. Practical implications: Supply chain managers can utilise data to embed the required degree of resilience in their supply chains by considering the proposed framework elements and phases.

However, the rapid expansion of AI and its use in legal settings, such as contract performance, in a company is a major challenge on the judicial side. This article, thus, establishes an evolutionary game model of whether manufacturing suppliers are performing contracts or not when the court chooses to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Considering the complexity of choosing manufacturers' AI strategy, the method constructs a simulation analysis model of manufacturers' contract enforcement behaviour with the participation of several subjects. We can simulate the influence of the factors selected on the strategy chosen by both parties (manufacturers and court) by changing the different influence factors and studying the evolutionary law of different court guidance and regulation strategies on the production behaviour of green products.

This article proposes a novel revenue-sharing coordination contract that benefits from text mining and the best–worst method to address this problem. We aim to determine a fair share of profit or loss of a movie for each of its actors based on their performance and efficiency on the success or failure of the project. One of the Iranian latest movies is considered as a case study, and its lead actor’s wage is determined under this contract. The sentiment analysis technique investigated the viewers’ opinions about the movie and the actor’s performance. Since the reviewers mainly are the people who have no expertise in cinematography, they cannot discern the influence of other participants on the actor’s performance. So the proposed method used experts’ opinions through the fuzzy DEMATEL method to consider the overlapping effect besides enhancing the validity of the reviewers’ opinions. The results of this paper assert that the actor’s performance will improve under the proposed method and therefore the movie will be more successful and profitable. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."",""Best worst method"; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Media supply chain management; Revenue-sharing coordination contract; Sentiment analysis;" Text mining"",""Behavioral research"; Data mining; Decision making; Efficiency; Motion pictures; Profitability; Sentiment analysis; Wages; BAD methods; Best bad method; DEMATEL; Fuzzy DEMATEL; Medium supply chain management; Performance; Revenue sharing contracts; Revenue-sharing; Revenue-sharing coordination contract; Sentiment analysis;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, evidence is scant on the uptake of digital technologies among small and medium agribusiness firms in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Against this backdrop, this review paper identifies research gaps regarding the adoption and implication of digitalization in building sustainable food systems for African economies. Our preliminary finds show some sustainable practices in the SSA food supply chains by adopting specific technologies related to production, grain storage, food waste management, and warehouse management but very low adoption of food processing technologies and digital marketing platforms.

These disasters play an important role in mobilizing several organizations to counteract them, but the organizations often find it hard to strike a fine balance between agility and resilience. Operations Management Scholars’ opinion remains divided between responsiveness and efficiency. However, to manage unexpected events like disasters, organizations need to be agile and resilient. In previous studies, scholars have adopted the resource-based view or dynamic capability view to explain the combination of resources and capabilities (i.e., technology, agility, and resilience) to explain their performance. However, following some recent scholarly debates, we argue that organizational theories like the resource-based view or dynamic capability view are not suitable enough to explain humanitarian supply chain performance. As the underlying assumptions of the commercial supply chain do not hold true in the case of the humanitarian supply chain. We note this as a potential research gap in the existing literature. Moreover, humanitarian organizations remain sceptical regarding the adoption of artificial intelligence-driven big data analytics capability (AI-BDAC) in the decision-making process. To address these potential gaps, we grounded our theoretical model in the practice-based view which is proposed as an appropriate lens to examine the role of practices that are not rare and are easy to imitate in performance. We used Partial Least Squares (PLS) to test our theoretical model and research hypotheses, using 171 useable responses gathered through a web survey of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The findings of our study suggest that AI-BDAC is a significant determinant of agility, resilience, and performance of the humanitarian supply chain. Furthermore, the reduction of the level of information complexity (IC) on the paths joining agility, resilience, and performance in the humanitarian supply chain. These results offer some useful theoretical contributions to the contingent view of the practice-based view. In a way, we have tried to establish empirically that the humanitarian supply chain designs are quite different from their commercial counterparts. Hence, the use of a resource-based view or dynamic capability view as theoretical lenses may not help capture true perspectives. Thus, the use of a practice-based view as an alternative theoretical lens provides a better understanding of humanitarian supply chains. We have further outlined the limitations and the future research directions of the study. © 2022"",""Artificial intelligence"; Big data analytics; Culture; Humanitarian operations management; Humanitarian supply chain; PLS-SEM; Practice-based view; Supply chain agility;" Supply chain resilience"",""Artificial intelligence"; Big data; Computational complexity; Decision making; Disasters; Least squares approximations; Supply chains; Big data analytic; Culture; Data analytics; Humanitarian operation management; Humanitarian operations; Humanitarian supply chain; Operation management; Partial least square-SEM; Partial least-squares; Practice-based view; Supply chain agility; Supply chain resiliences;" Data Analytics""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

First, the basic theories of supply chain and risk assessment are described, and the process of supply chain risk management is explained. Then, the ANN (artificial neural network) is discussed in detail. On this basis, the feasibility of the BP neural network applied in the risk assessment of the supply chain is analyzed. In addition, the risks of the supply chain system are analyzed under the support of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the indices for risk assessment of the supply chain are determined. The reliability analysis, validity analysis, and factor analysis of the evaluation indices are implemented using a questionnaire survey, based on which the risk assessment indices of the supply chain are determined as 7 first-level indices and 20 sesond-level indices. Finally, a BP neural network-based supply chain risk assessment model is established, and the simulation results are analyzed in MATLAB. The maximum relative error of the proposed BP neural network model for supply chain risk assessment is as low as 0.03076923%, and that calculated by the AHP (analytic hierarchy process) is 57.41%. Compared with that of AHP, the fitting degree of the BP neural network-based supply chain risk assessment model is much higher.

Additionally, how to improve the revenue of the new retail supply chain and the scientific and reasonable distribution of revenue is particularly important. On this background, the concept of new retail is defined, and the principle of supply chain synergy is analysed. Stackelberg game is used to analyse and determine the optimal selling and wholesale prices of retailers and suppliers in the supply chain. The defects of the traditional supply chain model and the necessity of optimization are further analysed and demonstrated. Because of the traditional retail supply chain, new retail channels are introduced, and the second-order supply chain is established. New retail channels are added to the supply chain, and the profitability before and after the addition is analysed. Stackelberg game and Shapley value method are used for modelling. Finally, Matlab is used for numerical analysis. The results show that adding new retail channels to the traditional supply chain dominated by suppliers will increase the market share of products. The market share f is positively correlated with the profits of suppliers and retailers.

DSCS has potential applications in risk management, supplier performance management, production planning, inventory optimization, quality management, supplier financing, and cost reduction in supply chains. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is potentially a key enabler and may facilitate a step change in DSCS. We present a framework, SDAR (Surveillance, Detection, Action, Response), to support the design of effective business processes for supply network surveillance. We outline the most important types of AI algorithms and models and discuss their applicability to a range of questions that arise in DSCS. By linking different surveillance data sources and systems, appropriate AI techniques can make surveillance easier, more informative, and scalable. However, AI-based DSCS gives rise to significant technical, ethical, and managerial challenges. These include the decomposition and reintegration of surveillance data and analyses, data imbalances, mitigation of biases in data, algorithms and statistical estimations, and the challenge of embedding DSCS in effective supplier monitoring and auditing processes. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Depending on the month of the year, blood group, and type of blood product, the demand for blood and blood products is geographically distributed and varies with seasonality. This study investigates the relationship between geographical concentration, seasonality of blood products' demand, and the amount of demand that is not fulfilled (unmet demand). We used various data analysis techniques such as geospatial mapping and ABC analysis to illustrate the seasonality and identification of geographical areas from which most of the demand arises. Furthermore, predictive machine learning (ML) models such as decision tree regressor and random forest regressor algorithms with selected features helped predict the dataset's total demand and unmet demand of the blood and blood products. This study shows that specific geographic locations such as large cities have most of the needs for various blood products. Moreover, there is a seasonality effect on the demand for particular months of the year. Additionally, the predictive model shows an accuracy of around 90%, which is an acceptable measure to forecast the demand.

First: Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, working alongside with Multi Objective Optimization (MOO), is adopted to determine the shortest path and time between two nodes to reach with the least cost.

It is important how to identify these disruptions and risks to avoid them, therefore many risk mitigation strategies have been developed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool to identify and predict the occurrence of risks, it is also important that the solutions to avoiding risks must be explainable for risk managers. Recently, making transparent and explainable AI models has been the focus of a large number of research studies and many post-hoc algorithms such as counter-factual explanation (CE) algorithms have been developed. In this paper, first we propose an optimization problem to design a transportation schedule for the supply chain network (SCN), then to increase the resiliency and transparency of the designed schedule, the CE model is integrated into the model as a set of constraints. To design the CE, a logistic regression model is developed. The CE helps to plan the transportation schedule to avoid any transportation delay risk. The integrated CE and SCM model is used as a recommender system for risk managers to mitigate risk to the system. Finally, to validate the recommender system, a real case study is analyzed and the solutions of the model with and without the CE are compared and it is shown that the CE-added constraints increase the resiliency of the system significantly while the increase in financial cost is less than 1%. Therefore, the model is validated for use for different risks and disruptions. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."",""Counterfactual explanation"; Recommender system; Resiliency;" Supply chain management"",""Intelligent systems"; Managers; Regression analysis; Supply chain management; Counterfactual explanation; Counterfactuals; Intelligence models; Logistic Regression modeling; Optimization problems; Research studies; Resiliency; Risk manager; Risk mitigation strategy; Supply chain network;" Recommender systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, having a good fruit yield forecast with anticipation allows making timely correct decisions for providing the resources, transport, and cold storage contracts, among others. Therefore, fruit yield over or underestimation could cause important inefficiencies with regards to FSC. Because of its relevance, a method based on machine learning (ML) techniques that uses spectrometric vegetation data is proposed. This method, known as Spectrometry Based Method for Fruit Production Forecast (SBM-Fruit), allows exploring the georeferenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), collected in different phenological stages, aiming to capture spatial and temporal dependency in the fruit yield forecast. In the first step of SBM-Fruit, several clusters are obtained in a clustering process using the georeferenced NDVI in all phenological stages as input, while, in the second step, two validation functions are used for determining the best clustering. Finally, in the third step, the predictor variables of the best clustering are incorporated into an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the fruit yield. The SBM-Fruit was applied to forecast table grape yield of an orchard located in the Valparaíso Region, Chile. The results show fruit yield estimations with mean errors around 0.013 percent for every spatial zone of the orchard, forecasted at least two months in advance.

This paper analyzes speed up performance of QC when applied to machine learning algorithms, known as Quantum Machine Learning (QML). We applied QML methods such as Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to detect Software Supply Chain (SSC) attacks. Due to the access limitations of real quantum computers, the QML methods were implemented on open-source quantum simulators such as IBM Qiskit and TensorFlow Quantum.

As all the companies and business organizations are closed for a certain time, therefore, the companies are facing financial issues. Therefore, the international business companies are facing the worst time because all the transport systems are closed and the transport system is an essential part of the international companies. In this situation, the companies have to adopt some efficient and effective strategies for the development of the financial condition of the companies. Thereafter, supply chain management is an important aspect of international companies because the companies provide their services and products to their international customers by using supply chain management.

However, there is no standard for measuring supply chain sustainability and business competitiveness. The objectives of this research were to analyze and criticize existing methods for supply chain sustainability assessment and develop a new framework for future research. This study reviewed 151 scientific articles related to supply chain sustainability assessments from 2004 to 2020. The results show that many techniques are used for sustainability assessments. However, no single technique can comprehensively measure supply chain sustainability. Therefore, a new robust technique that accommodates complex data in a sustainable supply chain is required. The technique to be developed is a machine learning technique because it can accommodate multi-criteria problems with various nonlinear relationships. This research is a case study of the sugarcane agroindustry supply chain. The supply chain of the sugarcane agroindustry faces various sustainability issues caused by negative environmental impacts. The analysis results show that using machine learning techniques to assess sustainability for the sugarcane agroindustry's supply chain has great potential to be developed.

As the COVID-19 vaccine is highly demanded, planning for its fair distribution is a must. University is one of the most densely populated areas in a city, so it is critical to vaccinate university students so that the spread of this virus is curbed. As a result, in the present study, a new stochastic multi-objective, multi-period, and multi-commodity simulation-optimization model has been developed for the COVID-19 vaccine's production, distribution, location, allocation, and inventory control decisions. In this study, the proposed supply chain network includes four echelons of manufacturers, hospitals, vaccination centers, and volunteer vaccine students. Vaccine manufacturers send the vaccines to the vaccination centers and hospitals after production. The students with a history of special diseases such as heart disease, corticosteroids, blood clots, etc. are vaccinated in hospitals because of accessing more medical care, and the rest of the students are vaccinated in the vaccination centers. Then, a system dynamic structure of the prevalence of COVID -19 in universities is developed and the vaccine demand is estimated using simulation, in which the demand enters the mathematical model as a given stochastic parameter. Thus, the model pursues some goals, namely, to minimize supply chain costs, maximize student desirability for vaccination, and maximize justice in vaccine distribution. To solve the proposed model, Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) algorithms are used. In terms of novelties, the most important novelties in the simulation model are considering the virtual education and exerted quarantine effect on estimating the number of the vaccines. In terms of the mathematical model, one of the remarkable contributions is paying attention to social distancing while receiving the injection and the possibility of the injection during working and non-working hours, and regarding the novelties in the solution methodology, a new heuristic method based on a meta-heuristic algorithm called Modified WOA with VNS (MVWOA) is developed. In terms of the performance metrics and the CPU time, the MOWOA is discovered with a superior performance than other given algorithms. Moreover, regarding the data, a case study related to the COVID-19 pandemic period in Tehran/Iran is provided to validate the proposed algorithm. The outcomes indicate that with the demand increase, the costs increase sharply while the vaccination desirability for students decreases with a slight slope. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",""Artificial intelligence algorithm"; Desirability for the vaccination; Distribution-location-allocation; Distributive justice; Simulation model; Stochastic optimization;" Vaccine supply chain"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are problems such as inaccurate procurement plans, large quantities of inventory sold out, chaotic procurement processes, and unclear inventory policies. Optimizing the procurement of basic raw materials will help reduce raw material costs. This paper analyzes some raw material supply chain processes through the Delphi method, Plato principle, and trend-adjusted exponential smoothing method and finds that the important factors for improving raw material supply include economic and technological environment, the realization of purchasing department functions, price stability, technical level, system management awareness, product qualification rate, quality inspection and testing, and problem handling timeliness. Financial situation, procurement efficiency, and cooperation compatibility are important factors for improving the supply of raw materials. By using key indicators to select strategic suppliers and computational intelligence to obtain the forecast value of raw material supply, the forecast error rate is within 9%, indicating that the forecast data are reliable and can be used as an auxiliary tool for raw material supply, thereby reducing risks. Under the corresponding conditions, the waste of raw materials can be reduced and the raw materials can be stored more reasonably. Using the Delphi method, Plato principle, and trend adjustment exponential smoothing method to analyze part of the raw material supply chain process brings benefits to the enterprise and finally achieves the standardization of the procurement process, the optimization of supplier groups, the sharing of procurement information, the supervision of procurement process, the reduction of purchasing costs, improvement of procurement intelligence, division of labor and performance assessment, and achievement of a win-win situation with suppliers. © 2022 Yan Dong."",,""Competition"; Cost reduction; Decision making; Forecasting; Materials handling; Supply chains; Delphi method; Economic growths; Exponential smoothing method; Market competition; Material supply chains; Optimisations; Procurement process; Raw material supply; Supply chain process; Traditional manufacturing;" Artificial intelligence""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, given today's level of interdependence of these entities that permits reduced mismatches in their processes, such organizations are more susceptive to disruptions in their networks. Over the past decades, global economies have experienced several crises induced by irrepressible circumstances that are either human-influenced, such as geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks, or provoked by nature, such as natural disasters and pandemic outbreaks. Hence, organizations have been placing substantial emphasis on supply chain resilience (SCR), with the objective of mitigating the impact of unforeseen risks on their supply chains, logistics, and their subsequent consequences on cost control and revenue maximization. Conventional SCR relied on increased safety stock levels, partial order allocations, supplier's diversifications, among others. On contrary, next generation of resilient supply chain operations can be reached by the digital transformation of its elements into the SCR modeling and control. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it introduces the role of the digital transformation, advanced analytics, automation, and augmentation of the SCR with the support of cyber-physical systems and security (CPSS) solutions from the industry 4.0 age. Second, it provides a structured view on artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) technologies, aiming to establish a robust, timely, and successful digital supply chain resilience (DSCR).

This was done in order to solve the current scientific gap of AI in Supply Chain Management. It was also found that there are holes in the existing study that need to be filled by more scientific investigation. To be more exact, the following four facets were discussed: (1) the AI approaches that are most often used in Supply Chain Management"; (2) the AI techniques that have the potential to be used in Supply Chain Management; (3) the Supply Chain Management subfields that have benefited from the application of AI so far;" and (4) the subfields that have a high potential to be improved by AI.

A deep learning-based pharmaceutical supply chain method called Epsilon Greedy Consensus-based Hadamard Deep Authentication (EGC-HDA) is proposed. The pharmaceutical supply chain management is deployed using Epsilon Greedy Consensus Block Validation which is capable of continuously monitoring and validating each block. Then, the Hadamard Gradient LSTM Authentication scheme is employed for authenticating blocks or the users (i.e., manufacturers, distributors, and resellers) in the deep learning module to do robust authentication. Security analysis of the proposed method is robust which attains performance in authentication time, latency, as well as true positive rate. In the experimental analysis, the results reveal that the EGC-HDA technique performs better with a 6% improvement in latency and true positive rate by 24%, and 7%, faster authentication time by 42% for the pharmaceutical supply chain compared to existing works. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden."",""Block Validation"; Blockchain; Consensus; Deep Learning; Epsilon Greedy; Hadamard Gradient; Long Short-Term Memory;" Pharmaceutical Supply Chain"",""Blockchain"; Long short-term memory; Medical problems; Supply chain management; Authentication techniques; Block validation; Block-chain; Consensus; Deep learning; Epsilon greedy; Hadamard; Hadamard gradient; Pharmaceutical supply chains; Supply chain process;" Authentication""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the continued depletion of wild fish stocks is leading to increased strain on the aquaculture sector in terms of sustaining the supply of fish and seafood to global markets. Despite the fact that aquaculture is more diversified than other agriculture sectors, there are significant pressures on the industry to continue innovating in order to enable sustainability including increased fish production, improved appropriate selection of species, disease mitigation, reduced wastage, preventing environmental pollution and generating more employment globally. This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains. There is also a commensurate need to avail of digital technologies in order to increase awareness of key industry issues across the value chain, such as through social marketing.

Lack of visibility often hinders effective risk planning and results in delayed discovery of supply chain problems, with examples ranging from product contamination, unsustainable production practices, or exposure to suppliers clustered in geographical areas prone to natural or man-made disasters. Initiatives that rely on manual collection of data often fail due to supply chain complexity and unwillingness of suppliers to share data. In this paper, we propose a neurosymbolic machine learning technique to proactively uncover hidden risks in supply chains and discover new information. Our method uses a combination of graph neural networks and knowledge graph reasoning. Unlike existing research our model is able to infer multiple types of hidden relationship risks, presenting a step change in automated supply chain surveillance. The approach has been tested on two empirical datasets from the automotive and energy industries, illustrating that it can provide inference in multiple types of links such as companies, products, production capabilities, certifications";" thereby facilitating complex queries that go beyond who-supplies-whom.

It mainly proposes a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) (IPSO-BPNN) and applies it to inventory management prediction. First, the important technologies of green supply chain and intelligent supply chain are analyzed from the perspective of the ecological environment. Next, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is optimized based on the adaptive improvement of the learning factor and the addition of the speed mutation operator. Then, it is applied to the learning and training of BPNN. Finally, the simulation experiment of the combination model is conducted. The application fields of the combination model are analyzed. The results show that a single BPNN model will produce large errors in the training process. The final error of BPNN using the traditional PSO algorithm is 0.0259, while the error of BPNN optimized by IPSO is 0.0163. The optimized combination model has higher accuracy, better performance, and the lowest error rate. The classification error rate of its training set and test set is 1.51 and 2.16, respectively. The mean square error of the training set is 0.0163 and that of the test set is 0.0229. Under 6 12 different hidden nodes, the daily measurement model error and monthly measurement model error are both low when the number of nodes is 11.

The data samples are preprocessed by PCA as the input data of the support vector machine, which effectively solves the problem of high-dimensional data in supply chain finance. By improving the inertia weight of particle swarm optimization and introducing mutation operation, a dynamic mutation particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to avoid the problem of particles falling into a local minimum in the process of optimization. Finally, the improved optimization algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of SVM and input AdaBoost integration as a weak classifier to build an integrated model with good performance in many aspects.

Through software dependencies, a multi-layer supply chain (SC) with a deep learning framework as the core and substantial down-stream projects as the periphery has gradually formed and is constantly developing. However, basic knowledge about the structure and characteristics of the SC is lacking, which hinders effective support for its sustainable development. Previous studies on software SC usually focus on the packages in different registries without paying attention to the SCs derived from a single project. We present an empirical study on two deep learning SCs: TensorFlow and PyTorch SCs. By constructing and analyzing their SCs, we aim to understand their structure, application domains, and evolutionary factors. We find that both SCs exhibit a short and sparse hierarchy structure. Overall, the relative growth of new projects increases month by month. Projects have a tendency to attract downstream projects shortly after the release of their packages, later the growth becomes faster and tends to stabilize. We propose three criteria to identify vulnerabilities and identify 51 types of packages and 26 types of projects involved in the two SCs. A comparison reveals their similarities and differences, e.g., TensorFlow SC provides a wealth of packages in experiment result analysis, while PyTorch SC contains more specific framework packages. By fitting the GAM model, we find that the number of dependent packages is significantly negatively associated with the number of downstream projects, but the relationship with the number of authors is nonlinear. Our findings can help further open the 'black box' of deep learning SCs and provide insights for their healthy and sustainable development. © 2022 ACM."",""deep learning"; open source; software evolution; software structure;" software supply chain"",""Deep learning"; Open source software; Open systems; Planning; Sustainable development; Deep learning; Down-stream; Driving forces; Exploratory studies; Multi-layers; Open-source; Software dependencies; Software Evolution; Software structures; Software supply chains;" Supply chains""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In such an environment, determining suitable inventory and cash replenishment policies ensures that cash and inventory are at the right place at the right time and provides a productive SC with high customer service levels. In this study, we first examine the impact of the disruptions in physical and financial flows on SC performance. We then, investigate the potential of a SC digital twin framework to help decision-makers in managing inventory and cash throughout the SC during disruption, currently absent from the literature. The proposed SC digital twin framework integrates machine learning (ML) and simulation to identify the inventory and cash replenishment policies that minimise the impact of the disruptions on SC performance. This approach proves effective in a SC disrupted by demand increase, capacity reduction, and credit purchase increase. Results show that employing the SC digital twin leads to a noticeable reduction in the cash conversion cycle for upstream members of the SCs. We observe that the cash conversion cycle for the upstream SC members is greatly impacted by the inventory policy employed by their immediate downstream members. © 2022 The Author(s).

Meanwhile, a logistic regression model is constructed based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, the two models conduct risk prediction on the test samples. The results indicate that the BPNN model can effectively predict various risks in the SCM process. It achieves an excellent evaluation effect of single risks, consistent with the actual results. Still, there are some deviations between the prediction results and the actual results of mixed risks. When the significance P value is more than 0.5, the sample is predicted to be of high risk. When it is less than 0.5, the sample is predicted to be of low risk. The prediction accuracy of the logistic regression model is as high as 92.8%, demonstrating brilliant applicability and popularization in the investment risk prediction of the supply chain.

Notwithstanding the operations-wise merits associated with the implementation of digital technologies, individually, their combined effect has been overlooked owing to limited real-world evidence. In this regard, this research explores the joint implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT) in supply chains for extending operations performance boundaries and fostering sustainable development and data monetisation. Specifically, this study empirically studied the tuna fish supply chain in Thailand to identify respective end-to-end operations, observe material and data-handling processes, and envision the implementation of AI and BCT. Therefore, we first mapped the business processes and the system-level interactions to understand the governing material, data, and information flows that could be facilitated through the combined implementation of AI and BCT in the respective supply chain. The mapping results illustrate the central role of AI and BCT in digital supply chains’ management, while the associated sustainability and data monetisation impact depends on the parameters and objectives set by the involved system stakeholders. Afterwards, we proposed a unified framework that captures the key data elements that need to be digitally handled in AI and BCT enabled food supply chains for driving value delivery.

In order to enable companies to make decisions that are in line with changes in the market, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize deep learning neural networks. Firstly, the model parameter setting is improved, and the inertia weight strategy of normal distribution attenuation is combined. On this basis, a normal distribution decay inertial weight particle swarm optimization (NDPSO) is proposed. The inertia weight of the optimized algorithm maintains a large value in the initial stage, which makes the PSO algorithm maintain a large step size in the optimization process and a small value in the later stage. Through experimental analysis, the trend parameter of the best normal distribution of the algorithm is obtained as 0.4433 and then using the detection function, the NDPSO algorithm is tested by two types of test functions. The NDPSO algorithm is compared with the optimization results of other algorithms which are optimized on the Sphere function. The minimum value of 554.29, the average value of 2032.11, and the standard deviation of 918.47, all of them are at the leading level. Taking into account other experimental results, it is proved that the normal distribution decay inertia weight can balance the global search and local development capabilities from the perspective of parameter improvement. It can speed up the convergence with ensuring the convergence accuracy. The improved PSO algorithm has certain optimization capabilities for neural network models. The use of optimized neural network models can enable companies to make decisions in line with changes in the market and optimize the dynamic relationship network of the company's supply chain, which is of great significance to the implementation of the company's international management. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."",""deep learning"; nationalized management; neural networks; particle swarm algorithm;" supply chain of enterprises"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

First, compared to classical concept lattice theory, the interval concept lattice theory can deal with uncertain information more accurately. It is used to extract the objects within the interval parameters [α, β], and then interval concepts and lattice structure are built. Second, based on the interval concepts and lattice structure, the association rule mining algorithm is designed to further extract the association rules under different interval parameters. Third, to obtain the effective association degree between two objects, the rule optimization algorithm is put forward by comparing the update of rules. Finally, the association degree can indirectly reflect the substitutability between products. Then the price of a new product can be determined.

With the progress of economic internationalization, economic and trade ties around the world have become closer and closer, and the level of international business exchanges has been improved. The rise of multinational e-commerce has also caused unprecedented difficulties to multinational logistics and supply chain management. The application of deep neural networks in various fields provides opportunities for cross-border e-commerce platforms to solve these problems. The existing logistics distribution model cannot keep up with the development of CBEC and has become a constraint and bottleneck for the development of CBEC. Therefore, this article introduces deep learning neural network to cross-border logistics and supply chain based on the analysis of the existing cross-border logistics model and supply chain model and the status quo of e-commerce development. It optimizes the existing cross-border logistics and supply chain network in order to break through the current bottleneck in the development of CBEC. This paper shows through research that introducing deep learning neural networks into CBEC logistics and supply chain can improve the efficiency of logistics and supply chain. Compared with the previous efficiency, the efficiency of network optimization can be increased to about 50%, reducing the cost of cross-border logistics and supply chain.

In this paper, we study the vulnerability of targeted poisoning attacks for linear regression demand forecasting models, where the attacker controls the behavior of forecasting models on a specific target sample without compromising the overall forecasting performance. We devise a gradient-optimization framework for targeted regression poisoning in white-box settings, and further design a regression value manipulation strategy for targeted poisoning in black-box settings. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets with four linear regression models. The results demonstrate that our attacks are very effective, and can achieve a high prediction deviation with control of less than 1% training samples.

According to the proposed network, a new multi-objective, multi-period, multi-echelon mathematical model for the distribution-allocation-location problem is designed. Another important novelty in this paper is that it considers an Internet-of-Things application in the COVID-19 condition in the suggested model to enhance the accuracy, speed, and justice of vaccine injection with existing priorities. Waste management, environmental effects, coverage demand, and delivery time of COVID-19 vaccine simultaneously are therefore considered for the first time. The LP-metric method and meta-heuristic algorithms called Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO), and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithms are then used to solve the developed model. The other significant contribution, based on two presented meta-heuristic algorithms, is a new heuristic method called modified GWO (MGWO), and is developed for the first time to solve the model. Therefore, a set of test problems in different sizes is provided. Hence, to evaluate the proposed algorithms, assessment metrics including (1) percentage of domination, (2) the number of Pareto solutions, (3) data envelopment analysis, and (4) diversification metrics and the performance of the convergence are considered. Moreover, the Taguchi method is used to tune the algorithm’s parameters. Accordingly, to illustrate the efficiency of the model developed, a real case study in Iran is suggested.

Each of these steps requires design development of secure product tracking, privacy preservation, transparent transaction handling, trust modelling and distributed processing operations. These operational characteristics can be directly mapped with blockchains, because they provide transparency, traceability, immutability, and distributed mining operations. Thus, blockchains are quickly gaining popularity as one of the most favorable solutions for SCM modelling. In order to model SCM, a wide variety of blockchain-based solutions are proposed by researchers over the years, and each of these solutions vary in terms performance parameters. These parameters include, response time, scalability, security level, delay to add a new block, cost of deployment, and computational complexity. Due to such a wide variety of algorithmic availability, it becomes ambiguous for SCM designers to select the best blockchain models for a given application. In order to reduce this ambiguity, a survey of recently proposed blockchain models for SCM application are discussed in this text. Most of these models are based on machine learning, and are characterized on the basis of their nuances, advantages, limitations, and possible future research scopes. Upon referring this descriptive review, readers would be able to summarize characteristics for each SCM implementation, and identify the best suited models for their deployments. This text also compares the reviewed models in terms of statistical parameters like delay of block mining, searching time for SCM transaction, security level, computational complexity, and probable use cases. These performance metrics are compared across different models in order to estimate the best performing models for a given blockchain application. After referring this comparison, researchers will be able identify most optimum model their configuration for application-specific SCM deployments. Furthermore, this text also recommends various methods to improve performance of the reviewed models in order to apply them for real-time deployments. © 2022 IEEE."",""Blockchain"; machine learning; performance; privacy; SCM; security;" transparency"",""Computational complexity"; Distribution of goods; Machine learning; Supply chain management; Transparency; Block-chain; Design development; Multiple process; Performance; Privacy; Privacy preservation; Product tracking; Security; Security level; Trust models;" Blockchain""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The historical demand information was used for forecasting future demands using several autoregressive integrated moving average models like AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA. By comparing their Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) values we get to know that ARIMA model is best suited for demand forecasting of the current retail item sale data. The result from the proposed work so obtained proves that the proposed model could be utilized for demand forecasting to meet the future demands in the retail sales item company. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."",""Autoregressive integrated moving average (Arima)"; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Demand forecasting; Epidemic outbreak; Globalization; Industry-4.0; Logistics; Manufacturing; Procurement; Retail industry; Sourcing; Supply chain; Supply chain management;" Time series"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Supply chain resilience can be improved by developing business continuity capabilities using artificial intelligence (AI). This research examines how companies use artificial intelligence (AI) and looks at ways that AI can improve supply chain resilience by increasing visibility, reducing risk, and improving sourcing and distribution. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV), which is caused by the lethal virus SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus), has become critical especially as the epidemic spreads. X-rays and computed tomography scans are examples of medical imaging that can help in diagnosis. CT scans are preferable over RT-PCR tests because of their inaccuracy. In this era of fast technological growth, using artificial intelligence methodologies to construct models with a higher performance volume and better accuracy predictions is a huge step forward. Medical image analysis incorporating image processing and computer vision techniques were used to analyse the chest Radiographs and train the models. The accuracy and significant amount of data collection and prediction supply chain for efficient detection of COVID-19 utilising Artificial Intelligence techniques are described in this study. Models are built using data obtained by local CT scan centres. The data can be reviewed from time to time in coordination with CT scan centres. The application will provide accurate predictions so this has a significant impact on the tool's market worth. For the post-COVID-19 period, many firms are hastening the creation of management plans with supply chain transformation in mind. In this pandemic, but even so, the market will be even narrower, so without using a decentralised governance framework with an imbalanced structure among various markets, it really should be moved to a centralised management strategy that combines advantage of the existing strength of a blocked setup, with almost as much vicinity to the manufacturing countries and regions. In a stronger emphasis Supply Chain Management, value management, in value analysis, plays a significant role. Real-time raw data of chest CT scans from hospitals were considered and used it to train the model after pre-processing it. In a chest CT scan, multiple perspectives and organs are focused, but the work solely used the axial perspective of the lungs to prepare the dataset. Around 1900 photos of each COVID and Normal are included in the dataset. The data was pre-processed with a range filter for noise reduction, cropping, data augmentation, and other minor operations such as adjusting the image brightness and sharpness. Deep Learning algorithms are trained using this pre-processed data. VGG16, ResNet101, Inception v2, DesneNet169, and Mobile net are implementations of deep learning algorithms that is developed. The same dataset was used to train the above models, however because each model has a distinct architecture, the accuracy of the models varies slightly. The test dataset for all of the models includes 300 images in each class, and the findings demonstrate that DenseNet169 has the best accuracy among the models, while ResNet101 has the poorest. Furthermore, the medical image analysis of Covid-19 by several models aids in the selection of the most accurate model for COVID-19 predictions from CT scans. A windows application for the prediction of COVID has been developed where the user will upload the CT scan image and has an option to specify model and get the prediction. If tested positive, user can also view the infected area in the image. This application uses DenseNet169 as default model, in case user does not specify the model, as it performs the best. The user can view the COVID protocols and related queries from WHO website using a query button. The availability of CT scans and other commodities for this application varies as a result of the pandemic, which has an impact on the global supply chain and the market price of this tool. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."",""AI"; Computer vision; Deep learning; DenseNet169; Inception V2; Mobile net; ResNet101; Supply chain management; Transfer learning;" VGG-16"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Developing a product, distributing it to suppliers, delivering to customers, collecting feedback, etc., all are tracked and maintained using supply chain management. A secured supply chain should be held to ensure that fake products do not enter into the market. For example";" if counterfeit drugs enter the market, then it will have various side effects on patients as well as it will affect the pharmaceutical companies. Hence, a secure supply chain is a must. The significance of SCM has increased as it plays a vital role in the decision-making process. Hence, a proper supply chain should be maintained along with a technology which will also help in the decision-making process. One such technology is Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is the technology in which machines are programmed to think like humans and perform an action accordingly. Machine Learning can be used in detecting fake products that enter the market. Also, there are various algorithms in AI which can be used in the decision-making process. As the digitalization of SCM is significant, similarly, its security is also worthwhile. SCM can be implemented as a Drug Supply chain Management system, which Blockchain can be integrated to counter the supply of counterfeit drugs into the market by tracking.

A structured method for configuring spare parts SCs should be used to determine whether to centralise or decentralise inventory management, also considering hybrid configurations. Moreover, such a method should define whether or not to switch the production of spare parts from Conventional Manufacturing (CM) technologies to Additive Manufacturing (AM) ones. Indeed, AM is considered the next revolution in the field of spare parts, and the adoption of AM technologies strongly affects the characteristics of SCs. However, the choice between centralisation and decentralisation is not the subject of much scientific research, and it is also not clear when AM would be the preferable manufacturing technology for spare parts. This paper aims to assist managers and practitioners in determining how to design their spare parts SCs, thus defining both the spare parts SC configuration and the manufacturing technology to adopt through the development of a decision support system (DSS). The proposed DSS is a user-friendly decision tree, and, for the first time, it allows comparison of the total costs of SCs characterised by different degrees of centralisation with both AM and CM spare parts. © 2022 The Author(s).

The analysis of this big qualitative data was performed using machine learning–based software – Leximancer. Findings: Positive and negative sentiment towards panic buying during the COVID-19 crisis was observed in the UGC. No significant differences in social media UGC sentiment between the three countries were found";" however, differences did exist in key themes. This suggests that the focus, not the sentiment, of consumers’ responses to panic buying differed across countries. Social media users follow their location-based and topic-consonant social “herd”, rather than the global “herd”.

The herd mentality of social networks is dependent on factors such as the geographic location of the social network (herd), which can differ from the global herd’s reaction, specifically in terms of topics evident in UGC. Practical implications: Operations and supply chain managers need to include social media UGC analysis in their strategies in crisis management responses. The topics, not the sentiment, of consumers’ responses to panic buying require managerial actions.

It is anticipated that the future business environment will be characterized by a variety of intelligent systems and autonomous robots. In 2017, the International Federation of Robotics reported that momentum gained by robotic technologies is strong and that the sales volumes of both service and industrial robots is expected to grow. Building on this projection, the present study proposes a set of prerequisites or key determinants for the adoption of autonomous robots in the supply chain and logistics industry: technological context (i.e., relative advantage, complexity, and cost), organizational context (i.e., management support, financial support and employee competence) and environmental context (i.e., competitive pressure, customer pressure and vendor support). The study adapts a quantitative research design and uses an online survey to collect the needed data to test the conceptual framework and hypotheses proposed. Part of the study results confirms the association between the cost of digital technologies and the adoption of autonomous robots.

Over the past few decades, multi-vehicle route planning was mainly implemented by heuristic algorithms. However, these algorithms face the dilemma of long computation time. In recent years, some machine learning-based methods are also proposed for vehicle route planning, but the existing algorithms can hardly solve multi-vehicle time-sensitive problems. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning model, which optimizes the route length and the vehicle's arrival time simultaneously. The model is based on the encoder-decoder framework. The encoder mines the relationship between the customer nodes in the problem, and the decoder generates the route of each vehicle iteratively. Specially, we design multiple route recorders to extract the route history information of vehicles and realize the communication between them. In the inferring phase, the model could immediately generate routes for all vehicles in a new instance. To further improve the performance of the model, we devise a multi-sampling strategy and obtain the balance boundary between computation time and performance improvement. In addition, we propose a simulation-based vehicle configuration method to select the optimal number of vehicles in real applications. For validation, we conduct a series of experiments on problems with different customer amounts and various vehicle numbers. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other typical algorithms in both performance and calculation time.

These two models were tested on Vietnamese coffee demand data. The results demonstrated that traditional and machine learning forecasting methods have different impacts on supply chain performance. The machine learning forecasting method outperformed the traditional method regarding operational and financial metrics. Three relevant operating and one financial metrics are selected, such as bullwhip effect (BWE), net stock amplification (NSAmp), and transportation cost (TC), and inventory turn (IT), respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."",""Demand forecasting"; Machine learning;" Supply chain performance"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This study aims to identify the stages of the information systems planning (ISP) process that affect the success of developing a strategic decision support system (DSS) for improving the decision-making process in the agrifood supply chains. Data were collected from 66 IT executives from Greek small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the agrifood sector and analyzed using regression analysis. The results revealed that situation analysis is the only stage of ISP that predicts ISP success. These findings can assist managers in appreciating the critical role of ISP for improving the performance of agrifood supply chain operations.

This paper reviews the literature surrounding digitalization in FSCs. A bibliometric and key-route main path analysis was carried out to objectively and analytically uncover the knowledge development in digitalization within the context of sustainable FSCs. The research began with the selection of 2140 articles published over nearly five decades. Then, the articles were examined according to several bibliometric metrics such as year of publication, countries, institutions, sources, authors, and keywords frequency. A keyword co-occurrence network was generated to cluster the relevant literature. Findings of the review and bibliometric analysis indicate that research at the intersection of technology and the FSC has gained substantial interest from scholars. On the basis of keyword co-occurrence network, the literature is focused on the role of information communication technology for agriculture and food security, food waste and circular economy, and the merge of the Internet of Things and blockchain in the FSC. The analysis of the key-route main path uncovers three critical periods marking the development of technology-enabled FSCs. The study offers scholars a better understanding of digitalization within the agri-food industry and the current knowledge gaps for future research. Practitioners may find the review useful to remain ahead of the latest discussions of technologyenabled FSCs.

In this study, we study the effects associated with AI automation of the retailer's order decision in a decentralized supply chain comprising one supplier and one regretful retailer. In the absence of AI automation, the retailer has a regret bias in that it behaves as though considering the deviation between the realized demand and order quantity, when making an ex ante inventory decision. We find that if profit margins of the supply chain are high, regret bias drives the retailer to decline the supplier's contract, whereas, if profit margins are low, regret drives retailers to order more from the supplier. As a result, although the automation of retailer decision leads to a higher expected profit for a retailer that operates in a centralized vacuum, it nevertheless can be a negative force for a decentralized supply chain with either high or low profit margins. Perhaps more interestingly, as a retailer's decision becomes automatic, it is not destined to earn a higher expected profit. In the extreme, a lose-lose outcome can prevail in which automation potentially leaves both the retailer and supplier worse off. © 2021 Production and Operations Management Society"",""Artificial Intelligence"; emotion; human–machine reconcile; Industry 4.0;" managerial bias"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The first step in risk management is risk identification, in which the risk manager identifies the risk events of interest for further analysis. The timely identification of risk events in the risk identification step is crucial for the risk manager to be proactive in managing the supply chain risks in its operations. Undertaking this step manually, however, is tedious and time-consuming. With the increased sophistication and capability of advanced computing algorithms, various eminent supply chain researchers have called for the use of artificial intelligence techniques to increase efficiency and efficacy when performing their tasks.

The analysis was informed by data collected from 479 manufacturing companies to determine the most significant AI applications used for SCRes. The findings show that fuzzy logic programming, machine learning big data, and agent-based systems are the most promising techniques used to promote SCRes strategies. The study findings support decision-makers by providing an integrated decision-making framework to guide practitioners in AI deployment for building SCRes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."",""artificial intelligence"; EDAS; fuzzy system; multi-criteria decision-making; Supply-chain resilience;" wavelet neural networks"",""Decision making"; Fuzzy logic; Logic programming; Supply chain management; Agent-based systems; AI applications; Decision-making frameworks; Integrated decision makings; Manufacturing companies; Multi-criteria decision making; Supply chain resiliences; Wavelet neural networks;" Artificial intelligence""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To help printing-circuit-board (PCB) manufacturers conduct effective DP and SF, a demand-driven framework is presented to accomplish the following goals. First, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is employed to identify significant consumer products (smartphone, tablet, panel display, desktop, laptop, server, printer) affecting PCB sales volumes and revenues. Second, Holt-Winter’s smoothing (HWS) is constructed to predict global shipments of consumer products. Finally, statistical regression and ensemble learning are adopted to conduct forecasting and sensitivity analyses.

Transnational corporations are hailing these gains as a ‘game changer’ for advancing environmental sustainability. Yet, looking through a political economy lens, it is clear that AI is not advancing sustainability nearly as much as industry leaders are claiming. As this article argues, the metrics and rhetoric of corporate social responsibility are exaggerating the benefits and obscuring the costs of AI. Productivity and efficiency gains in the middle sections of supply chains are rebounding into more production and consumption, doing far more to enhance the profitability of big business than the sustainability of the earth. At the same time, AI is accelerating natural resource extraction and the distancing of waste, casting dark shadows of harm across marginalized communities, fragile ecosystems, and future generations. The micro-level gains from AI, as this article exposes, are not going to add up to macro-level solutions for the negative environmental consequences of global supply chains, while portraying AI as a force of sustainability is legitimizing business as usual, reinforcing a narrative of corporate responsibility, obfuscating the need for greater state regulation, and empowering transnational corporations as global governors.

As RO involves calculation of several statistical moments or maximum / minimum values involving the objective functions under realizations of these uncertain parameters, the accuracy of this method significantly depends on the efficient techniques to sample the uncertainty parameter space with limited amount of data. Conventional sampling techniques, e.g. box/budget/ellipsoidal, work by sampling the uncertain parameter space inefficiently, often leading to inaccuracies in such estimations. This paper proposes a methodology to amalgamate machine learning and data analytics with RO, thereby making it data-driven. A novel neuro fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to cluster the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are optimally identified. Subsequently, local density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based sampling to sample the uncertain parameter space more accurately. The proposed technique is utilized to explore the merits of RO towards addressing the uncertainty issues of product demand, machine uptime and production cost associated with a multiproduct, and multisite supply chain planning model. The uncertainty in supply chain model is thoroughly analysed by carefully constructing examples and its case studies leading to large scale mixed integer linear and nonlinear programming problems which were efficiently solved in GAMS® framework. Demonstration of efficacy of the proposed method over the box, budget and ellipsoidal sampling method through comprehensive analysis adds to other highlights of the current work. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"",""Data driven robust optimization"; Multi-layered perceptron; Neuro fuzzy clustering; Supply chain management;" Uncertainty modelling"",""Budget control"; Costs; Data Analytics; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Integer programming; Learning systems; Nonlinear programming; Uncertainty analysis; Chain management; Data driven robust optimization; Multilayered perceptrons; Neuro-fuzzy clustering; Parameter spaces; Robust optimization; Supply chain planning; Uncertain parameters; Uncertainty; Uncertainty modeling;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As the size of deep neural networks (DNN) continually increases, model quantization, which converts the full-precision model into lower-bit representation while mostly preserving the accuracy, becomes a prerequisite for deploying a well-trained DNN on resource-limited edge devices. However, to properly quantize a DNN requires an essential amount of expert knowledge, or otherwise the model accuracy would be devastatingly affected. Alternatively, recent years witness the birth of third-party model supply chains which provide pretrained quantized neural networks (QNN) for free downloading. In this paper, we systematically analyze the potential threats of trojaned models in third-party QNN supply chains. For the first time, we describe and implement a QUAntization-SpecIfic backdoor attack (QUASI), which manipulates the quantization mechanism to inject a backdoor specific to the quantized model. In other words, the attacker-specified inputs, or triggers, would not cause misbehaviors of the trojaned model in full precision until the backdoor function is automatically completed by a normal quantization operation, producing a trojaned QNN which can be triggered with a near 100% success rate. Our proposed QUASI attack reveals several key vulnerabilities in the existing QNN supply chains: (i) QUASI demonstrates a third-party QNN released online can also be injected with backdoors, while, unlike full-precision models, there is almost no working algorithm for checking the fidelity of a QNN. (ii) More threateningly, the backdoor injected by QUASI remains inactivated in the full-precision model, which inhibits model consumers from attributing undergoing trojan attacks to the malicious model provider. As a practical implication, we alarm it can be highly risky to accept and deploy third-party QNN on edge devices at the current stage, if without future mitigation studies. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery."",""Backdoor attack"; Model quantization;" Neural network"",""Deep neural networks"; Malware; Backdoor attack; Backdoors; Edge computing; Expert knowledge; Modeling accuracy; Modeling quantizations; Neural-networks; Precision model; Quantisation; Third parties;" Supply chains""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Shipment consolidation is usually utilized to reduce outbound shipments costs, but it can increase the lead time. Forecasting in this paper is performed in a make-to-order supply chain using real data, where the logistics company does not know the internal production data of manufacturers. Forecasting was performed in several steps using machine-learning methods such as linear regression and logistic regression. The last step checks if the order will come in the next delivery week or not. Forecasting is evaluated after each shipment delivery to check the possibility of delaying the current arriving orders for a certain customer until the next week or making the delivery to the customer immediately. The results showed reasonable accuracy expressed in different ways, and one of them depends on a type I error with an average value of 0.07.

The reasons quoted include the immaturity of technology, a lack of interoperability with supply chain information systems, and a lack of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we revisit the agent-based supply chain and review the state of the art. We find that agent-based technology has matured, and other supporting technologies that are penetrating supply chains;" are filling in gaps, leaving the concept applicable to a wider range of functions. For example, the ubiquity of IoT technology helps agents “sense” the state of affairs in a supply chain and opens up new possibilities for automation. Digital ledgers help securely transfer data between third parties, making agent-based information sharing possible, without the need to integrate Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Learning functionality in agents enables agents to move beyond automation and towards autonomy.

The problem is solved using a rolling horizon approach. Benders decomposition is used to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem. To promote risk-averse decisions, a downside risk measure is incorporated in the model. The results demonstrate the several advantages of modular designs in meeting product demands.

An efficient supply chain must have a symmetry of information between participating entities, but in reality, the information is asymmetric, causing problems. The sustainability of the supply chain continues to be threatened because companies are reluctant to disclose information to others. If companies participating in the supply chain do not disclose accurate information, the next best way to improve the sustainability of the supply chain is to use data from the supply chain to determine each enterprise’s information. This study takes data from the supply chain and then uses machine learning algorithms to find which enterprise the data refer to when new data from unknown sources arise. The machine learning algorithms used are logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, decision tree, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and multi-layer perceptron. Indicators for evaluating the performance of multi-class classification machine learning methods are accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

While the broader field of AI has made rapid advances in a relatively short period of time, there are significant barriers that still need to be addressed to harness the true potential of AI. SCM’s dependency on multi-actor collaboration, disparate data sources, unwillingness of actors to embrace AI, change management issues, and lack of AI governance framework poses significant barriers for successful implementation of AI. Drawn from extensive literature review as well as real-world experience, this paper systematically explores and compiles a robust list of barriers of AI implementation in supply chain functions by categorizing them and elaborating their impact at inter- and intra-organizational SCM.

This framework further offers a specific roadmap as a practical contribution while investigating companies with restricted resources. In this study the main barriers are classified as ‘economic’, ‘environmental’, ‘social and legal’, ‘technological’, ‘supply chain management’ and ‘strategic’ with twenty-seven sub-barriers. Various big data solutions such as machine learning, optimization, data mining, cloud computing, artificial neural network, statistical techniques and social network analysis have been suggested. Big data solutions are matched with circularity focused barriers to show which solutions succeed in overcoming barriers. A hybrid decision framework based on the fuzzy ANP and the fuzzy VIKOR is developed to find the weights of the barriers and to rank the big data driven solutions.

In the meantime, demands are also affected by many hidden factors that again require a large amount of data and more sophisticated models to capture. We propose to overcome these challenges by a novel demand forecasting framework which “borrows” time series data from many other products (cross-series training) and trains the data with advanced machine learning models (known for detecting patterns).

The deep reinforcement learning agent is built upon the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, which does not require hardcoded action space and exhaustive hyperparameter tuning. These features, complimented with a straightforward supply chain environment, give rise to a general and task unspecific approach to adaptive control in multi-echelon supply chains.

The base-stock policy is prevalent in continuous-review inventory systems. The paper concludes with the statement that the proposed solution can perform adaptive control in complex supply chains.

This paper presents a deep learning approach to optically detect hidden hardware trojans in the manufacturing and assembly phase of printed circuit boards to secure electronic supply chains. Trojans can serve as backdoors of accessing on chip data, can potentially alter functioning and in some cases may even deny intended service of the chip. Apart from consumer electronics, printed circuit boards are used in mission critical applications like military and space equipment. Security compromise or data theft can have severe impact and thus demand research attention. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can be implemented in a manufacturing environment with limited training data. It can also provide better coverage in detection of hardware trojans over traditional methods. Image recognition algorithms need to have deeper penetration inside the training layers for recognizing physical variations of image patches. However, traditional network architectures often face vanishing gradient problem when the network layers are added. This hampers the overall accuracy of the network. To solve this a Residual network with multiple layers is used in this article. The ResNet34 algorithm can identify manufacturing tolerances and can differentiate between a manufacturing defect and a hardware trojan. The ResNet operates on the fundamental principle of learning from the residual of the output of preceding layer. In the degradation issue, it is observed that, a shallower network performs better than deeper network. However, this is with the downside of lower accuracy. Thus, a skip connection is made to provide an alternative path for the gradient to skip forward the training of few layers and add in multiple repeating blocks to achieve higher accuracy and lower training times. Implementation of this method can bolster automated optical inspection setup used to detect manufacturing variances on a printed circuit board. The results show a 98.5% accuracy in optically detecting trojans by this method and can help cut down redundancy of physically testing each board. The research results also provide a new consideration of hardware trojan benchmarking and its effect on optical detection. © Copyright © 2021 Kulkarni and Xu."",""artificial intelligence"; deep learning; hardware cybersecurity; hardware trojan; optical inspection;" printed circuit boards manufacturing"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The applications of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in different processes of supply chains have assisted companies to improve their performance. Procurement can be considered a critical process in supply chain management since it can provide novel opportunities for supply chains to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. However, I4.0 applications can be costly and may not be reasonably affordable. Therefore, the benefits of implementing these technologies should be clarified for procurement managers before investing in the digitalization of the procurement process. Despite the importance of this issue, few papers have attempted to address the effects of I4.0 technologies and smart systems in procurement. To fill this gap, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the applications of I4.0 technologies in procurement has been used in this study. By reviewing 70 papers through appropriate keywords, a conceptual framework is developed to classify different value propositions provided by the different applications of I4.0 technologies in procurement processes.

The BE phenomenon has been detected in various industries and sectors, and causes multiple inefficiencies such as higher costs of producing more than needed, wastage and transportation costs. As a result, BE forecast is of great importance for academics and supply chain managers. Despite the multitude of studies that have emerged addressing this issue, the impact of the quality of dynamic forecasts on the BE has received limited coverage in the literature. Optimal dynamic forecasts of the demand could allow managers to mitigate the upstream amplification of orders (and thus the BE), as well as reduce unnecessary inventory costs. Order quantity and BE in a supply chain depend on the forecast of the future demand. Usually minimum mean square error (MMSE) forecasts of the future demand are obtained by fitting an appropriate seasonal auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) time series model. However, a major drawback of the MMSE forecasting method is that it does not provide the associated risk forecasts. In this paper, a simple yet effective machine learning demand forecasting approach without fitting any time series model is presented. Specifically, a novel data driven machine learning algorithm that bypasses traditional forecasting steps and allows forecast weights to be optimized by minimizing the one-step ahead forecast error sum of squares (FESS) is proposed. A novel stability metric of a supply chain is proposed as the risk adjusted forecast of the future demand. It is shown that the risk adjusted forecasts can be used to check whether a given supply chain is resilient. In order to be more resilient and competitive in the current market, business leaders around the world agree that it is necessary to modernize and make major changes to their supply chain strategies. Demand risk forecasts obtained by the proposed machine learning approach allow supply chain managers to enhance the forecasting power of the order quantity and construct more resilient supply chains.

The existing Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) is used by the European Commission, national competent authorities of member countries and the European Food Safety Authority to report information on any direct or indirect human health risk arising from food or feed, or serious risks to animal health or the environment in relation to feed. Nevertheless, no methods exist to to collectively evaluate this vast source of supply chain information. Methods To aid in the extraction, evaluation and visualization of the data in RASFF notifications, we present the Rapid Alert Supply Network Extractor (RASNEX) open-source tool available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4322555 freely. Among RASNEX’s functions is the graphical mapping of food and feed supply chain operators implicated in contamination events. RASNEX can be used during ongoing events as a support tool for risk analysis using RASFF notifications as input. Results In a first use case, we showcase the functionality of RASNEX with the RASFF notification on a 2017/2018 contamination event in eggs caused by the illegal use of fipronil. The information in this RASFF notification is used to visualize nine different flows of main and related food products. In a second use case, we combine RASFF notifications from different types of food safety hazards (Salmonella spp., fipronil and others) to obtain wider coverage of the visualized egg supply network compared to the first use case. Actors in the egg supply chain were identified mainly for Italy, Poland and Benelux. Other countries (although involved in the egg supply chain) were underrepresented. Conclusions We hypothesize that biases may be caused by inconsistent RASFF reporting behaviors by its members. These inconsistencies may be counteracted by implementing standardized decision-making tools to harmonize decisions whether to launch a RASFF notification, in turn resulting in a more uniform future coverage across European food and feed supply chains with RASNEX. © 2021 Lorenzen et al.

However, managing various operations in OaG-SC industries is a challenging task due to the involvement of various stakeholders. It includes landowners, Oil and Gas (OaG) company operators, surveyors, local and national level government bodies, financial institutions, and insurance institutions. During mining, OaG company needs to pay incentives as a royalty to the landowners. In the traditional existing schemes, the process of royalty transaction is performed between the OaG company and landowners as per the contract between them before the start of the actual mining process. These contracts can be manipulated by attackers (insiders or outsiders) for their advantages, creating an unreliable and un-trusted royalty transaction. It may increase disputes between both parties. Hence, a reliable, cost-effective, trusted, secure, and tamper-resistant scheme is required to execute royalty contract transactions in the OaG industry. Motivated from these research gaps, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme, which securely executes the royalty transactions among various stakeholders in OaG industries.

Accordingly, this paper presents a systematic literature review of 136 papers from 2010 to 2020 from WOS and Scopus databases regarding these barriers to understand CE implementation in food supply chains. The barriers are classified under seven categories: “cultural”, “business and business finance”, “regulatory and governmental”, “technological, “managerial”, “supply-chain management”, “knowledge and skills”. The findings show the need to identify barriers preventing the transition to CE. The findings also indicate that these challenges to CE can be overcome through Industry 4.0, which includes a variety of technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud technologies, machine learning, and blockchain. Specifically, machine learning can offer support by making workflows more efficient through the forecasting and analytical capabilities of food supply chains.

These risks, such as drastic changes in demand, machine failures, or systems not properly configured, can lead to planning or execution issues in the supply chain. It is too expensive to have planners continually track all situations at a granular level to ensure that no deviations or configuration problems occur. We present a machine learning system that predicts service-level failures a few weeks in advance and alerts the planners. The system includes a user interface that explains the alerts and helps to identify failure fixes. We conducted this research in cooperation with Michelin. Through experiments carried out over the course of four phases, we confirmed that machine learning can help predict service-level failures. In our last experiment, planners were able to use these predictions to make adjustments on tires for which failures were predicted, resulting in an improvement in the service level of 10 percentage points. Additionally, the system enabled planners to identify recurrent issues in their supply chain, such as safety-stock computation problems, impacting the overall supply chain efficiency. The proposed system showcases the importance of reducing the silos in supply chain management.

The notion of Physical Internet (PI) is one such evolution, an innovative worldwide logistic paradigm aimed at interconnecting and coordinating logistics networks for efficiency and sustainability. This paper investigates how digital interoperability can help interconnect logistics and supply networks as well as the operational solutions for sustainable development, and examines the new challenges and research opportunities for digital interoperability under the PI paradigm. To this end, we study the most relevant technologies for digital interoperability in LSCM, via a bibliometric analysis based on 208 papers published during 2010−2020. The results reveal that the present state-of-the-art solutions of digital interoperability are not fully aligned with PI requirements and show new challenges, research gaps and opportunities that need further discussion.

Big data is being generated today by web applications, social media, intelligent machines, sensors, mobile phones, and other smart handheld devices. Big data is characterized in terms of the velocity, volume, and variety with which it produces along the supply chain. This is due to recent advances in telecommunication networks along with centralized and decentralized data storage systems, which are processed thanks to modern digital computational capabilities. There is a growing interest in the use of this large volume of data and advanced analytics for diverse types of business problems in supply chain management (SCM). Such decision-support software applications employ pure mathematical techniques, artificial intelligence techniques, and sometimes uses both techniques to perform analytical operations that undercover relationships and patterns within supply chain generated big data.

This research provides insights into AI application for optimizing SC processes in order to decrease energy demand and CO2 emission. The AI engine is based on a Cyber Physical System (CPS) developed using business activities as defined by business processes. A Monte Carlo simulation is adopted to ensure that the baseline (CPS) model is statistically representative.

Further, this research aims to formulate the right policies for improving the performance of the chain based on the success factor that belongs to cause groups. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyses 10 success factors for improving the performance of the Indonesian dairy supply chain with the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method and analyses the Delphi method to formulate the right policies for improving performance. Findings: There are four important influencing factors that directly impact the overall system, i.e. the number of dairy cattle import, national milk demand, the total number of dairy farmers and the number of dairy cattle ownership or herd size. Several alternative policies have been designed by several experts according to the influencing factors, i.e. the government assists in the procurement of imported cattle, provides financial assistance to farmers in the form of low-interest financing, improves the partnership system between farmers and dairy cooperatives, provides a reward system for the farmers and increases the level of formality of contract between the farmers and cooperatives. Research limitations/implications: Interrelationships of each success factor and the most important influencing success factors could not be generally determined because it depends on the point of view of the experts. Future research can apply the success factors proposed by this research to the different dairy milk supply chain. Then, this research used only nine experts for formulating alternative policies. Future research may repeat this method using multiple experts to justify the validity of the research. Moreover, this research only explored 21 success factors of the increase in the performance of the Indonesian dairy supply chain. Future research should consider not only the supply side and number of dairy cattle but also several success factors from the causal relationship diagram in the broader dairy milk supply chain. Practical implications: This research provides essential insights for policymakers, as they have to understand and evaluate the success factors before formulating several alternative policies. Social implications: The research has revealed that the right alternative policies can be designed, as the causal factor has been known. Originality/value: This research contributes to applying a combination of causal relationship diagram of System Dynamic and DEMATEL method as a qualitative and quantitative method in one integrated way through performance dairy supply chain analysis. As a result, this research draws a policy for the dairy supply chain referring to the success factor as a cause for the low performance of the Indonesian dairy supply chain. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""Causal relationship diagram"; Dairy supply chain; Data analysis; Data mining; Delphi; DEMATEL;" Supply chain management"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The valuable lessons learned from EV1 failure and Better Place bankruptcy paved the way for Tesla’s operations strategy to build gigafactories which bears a resemblance to Ford T mass production last century. Specifically, EV1 relied on external suppliers to develop batteries, while Better Place was dependent on a single manufacturer to build cars uniquely compatible with its charging infrastructure, whereas Tesla established a closed‐loop, green, vertically integrated supply chain consisting of batteries, electric cars and charging infrastructure to meet its customers evolving needs. The analysis unveils several limitations of the Tesla business model which can impede its worldwide expansion, such as utility grid overload and a shortage of raw material, which Tesla strives to address by innovating advanced batteries and further extending its vertically integrated supply chain to the mining industry.

This can support applying reverse factoring mechanisms in SCFs. Design/methodology/approach: Based on network science, the network measures of the actors collaborating in the investigated SCF are derived through a social network analysis. Then several supervised machine learning algorithms are applied to predict the credit risks of the actors on the basis of their network level and organizational-level characteristics. For this purpose, a data set from an SCF within an automotive industry in Iran is used. Findings: The findings of the research clearly demonstrate that considering the network attributes of the actors within the prediction models can significantly enhance the accuracy and precision of the models. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of this research is to investigate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model within a single case. Practical implications: The proposed model can provide a well-established basis for financial intermediaries in SCFs to make more sophisticated decisions within financial facilitation mechanisms. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature of credit risk evaluation by considering credit risk as a systematic risk that can be influenced by network measures of collaborating actors. To do so, the paper proposes an approach that considers network characteristics of SCFs as critical attributes to predict credit risk. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""Credit risk"; Social network analysis; Supervised machine learning;" Supply chain finance"",""Automotive industry"; Finance; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning; Supply chains; Accuracy and precision; Credit risk evaluation; Critical attributes; Design/methodology/approach; Network characteristics; Organizational levels; Supervised machine learning; Supply chain finances;" Risk assessment""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The history of agriculture in India starts from Indus Valley Civilization. But in such a historical country, many farmers are starving for their income while foreign countries are earning lakhs from the same. One of the reasons for the above cause is the very poor supply chain management. It is a well-known fact that most of the farming items decay very fast if not maintained properly. In the existing supply chain management, though the government provides storage houses for the farmers, the farmers could not track the status of their goods. Also, there is no proper system for tracking the status of their goods in the various stages of transportation. Hence, an improved supply chain management is needed with the desired properties such as checkpoints at every stage in the supply chain management, verification of goods status by both the farmers and the government officials. In this paper, a system is proposed that uses Blockchain technology to attain the transparency about the goods' status that leads to a healthier relationship between the producer and consumer. By storing the details in the blockchain, all the process is visible both to the farmers and officials involved in the transportation.

Yet, how to accurately predict the manufacturer's demand for components in the presence of end-customer demand uncertainty remains poorly understood. Assigning the proper order quantities of components to suppliers thus becomes a nontrivial task, with a significant impact on planning, capacity and inventory-related costs. This paper introduces a multivariate approach to predict manufacturer's demand for components throughout multiple forecast horizons using different leading indicators of demand shifts. We compare the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) with Machine Learning (ML) models. Using a real case study, we empirically evaluate the forecasting and supply chain performance of the multivariate regression models over the component's life-cycle. The experiments show that the proposed multivariate approach provides superior forecasting and inventory performance compared with traditional univariate benchmarks. Moreover, it reveals applicable throughout the component's life-cycle, not just to a single stage. Particularly, we found that demand signals at the beginning of the life-cycle are predicted better by the ARIMAX model, but it is outperformed by ML-based models in later life-cycle stages. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."",""ARIMAX"; Decision support; Forecasting; Machine learning;" Supply chain management"",""Benchmarking"; Life cycle; Manufacture; Production control; Regression analysis; Supply chains; Automotive supply chains; Autoregressive integrated moving average models; Inventory performance; Leading indicators; Multivariate approach; Multivariate regression models; Production Planning; Supply chain performance;" Forecasting""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Emerging processing technologies (high-pressure, pulsed electric fields, ohmic heating, ultrasound) and novel food systems (cultured biomass, 3-D bioprinting, cyber-physical chains) try to challenge the existing chains by developing potentially more nutritious and sustainable food solutions.

Global manufacturing bases were affected strongly by workforce shortages associated with the spread of COVID-19, and are working to increase productivity by embracing digital manufacturing technologies that take advantage of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) that offer the promise of improved connectivity among supply chains. This trend can increase and smooth the flow of social capital, which is a potential resource in supply chains and can affect supply chain performance in healthcare industry. However, such an issue has not been properly recognized as the best practice in healthcare industry. Thus, this study investigates empirically the relationship between digitalization and supply chain performance in healthcare manufacturing companies based on previous research that proposed a role for social capital. We surveyed the staff of domestic small and medium-sized healthcare manufacturing companies in South Korea currently operating or planning to deploy digital manufacturing technologies. Online and email surveys were utilized to collect the data. Invalid responses were excluded and the remaining 130 responses were analyzed using a structural equation model in SPSS with the AMOS module. We found that digitalization has a positive effect on the formation of social capital, which in turn has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The direct effect of digitalization on supply chain performance is small, and relatively large portions are mediated and influenced by social capital. The establishment of strategic relationships in the healthcare manufacturing industry is significant, as supply chain networks and production processes can influence the intended use of factory output. Companies should, therefore, secure timely and accurate information to manage the flow of products and services. The formation of social capital in the supply chain can help visualize entire supply chains and has a positive effect on real-time information-sharing among key elements of those chains. © 2021 by the authors.

The manufacturer and retailer are two supply chain players, where the retailer is unreliable and may not send accurate demand information to the manufacturer. As an advanced smart technology, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is implemented to track and trace each product’s movement on a real-time basis in the inventory. It takes this supply chain to a smart supply chain management. This research proposes a Machine Learning (ML) approach for on-demand forecasting under smart supply chain management. Using Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), the demand is forecasted to obtain the exact demand information to reduce the overstock or understock situation. A measurement for the environmental effect is also incorporated with the model. A consignment policy is applied where the manufacturer controls the inventory, and the retailer gets a fixed fee along with a commission for selling each product. The manufacturer installs RFID technology at the retailer’s place. Two mathematical models are solved using a classical optimization technique. The results from those two models show that the ML-RFID model gives a higher profit than the existing traditional system. © 2021 by the authors.

Traditional traceability data is stored in each node enterprise, and there are problems such as low collaboration trust and poor authenticity in the upstream and downstream data transmission process of the supply chain, which causes consumers to have a trust crisis in the authenticity of traceability information. The blockchain traceability system establishes a distributed database with multi-party participation and joint maintenance, and uses cryptography and consensus mechanisms to establish a trust relationship.

In this respect, improving short-term forecast accuracy is a way to build a more agile supply chain for manufacturing companies. Demand forecasting often relies on well-established univariate forecasting methods to extrapolate historical demand. Collaboration across the supply chain, including information sharing, is suggested in the literature to improve upon the forecast accuracy of such traditional methods. In this paper, we review empirical studies considering the use of downstream information in demand forecasting and investigate different modeling approaches and forecasting methods to incorporate such data. Where empirical findings on information sharing mainly focus on point-of-sale data in two-level supply chains, this research empirically investigates the added value of using sell-through data originating from intermediaries, next to historical demand figures, in a multi-echelon supply chain. In a case study concerning a US drug manufacturer, we evaluate different methods to incorporate this data and consider both time series methods and machine learning techniques to produce multi-step ahead weekly forecasts. The results show that the manufacturer can effectively improve its short-term forecast accuracy by integrating sell-through data into the forecasting process and provide useful insights as to the different modeling approaches used. The conclusion holds for all forecast horizons considered, though it is most pronounced for one-step ahead forecasts. Therefore, our research provides a clear incentive for manufacturers to assess the forecast accuracy that can be achieved by using sell-through data. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."",""Bullwhip effect"; Forecasting; Information sharing; Machine Learning;" Sell-through data"",""Information analysis"; Information dissemination; Inventory control; Learning systems; Manufacture; Production control; Sales; Scheduling; Supply chain management; Forecasting methods; Inventory management; Machine learning techniques; Manufacturing companies; Multi echelon supply chains; Operational forecasting; Production Scheduling; Short-term forecasts;" Forecasting""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In recent years blockchain technology (BT) has made an appearance as a paramount model, as it bestows secure tracking, benchmark, and trust formation between stakeholders in a cost-efficient solution. To control the foregoing concerns, data analytics is indispensable on blockchain-based secure data and hence elevates the significance of surfacing technology Machine Learning (ML). The reliability of data and its distribution are very pivotal in ML to enhance the accuracy of results. In this paper, a blockchain-based secured information sharing method called Lebesgue IntegrableConsensus and Interpolated Gaussian Learning-based (LIC-IGL) authentication to provide pharmaceutical data integrity and security is proposed. The LIC-IGL method is split into two sections. First, validation of block is performed by applying the Lebesgue Integrable Consensus model. The second step involves the authentication process carried out by employing the Adaptive Support Vector Machine Authentication model via smart contracts. Finally, upon successful authentication, distinct products are provided between and within the blocks, therefore, ensuring secured pharmaceutical product sharing. The effectiveness of the proposed and existing methods is compared with certain parameters such as latency, authentication accuracy, and false positive rate with respect to distinct numbers of products. The results acquired from the experiments exhibit a superior execution of the proposed method upon comparison with the state-of-the-art blockchain-based authentication methods and it shows enhanced simulated results with good authentication accuracy, minimizing the latency and false positive rate. © 2021 The Author(s)"",""Adaptive support vector machine"; Authentication; Blockchain technology; Machine learning;" Supply chain management"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Supply chain stakeholders conventionally transport their goods, along with the corresponding documentation via regulators for compliance checks. This is generally followed by a tedious and manual process to ensure the goods meet regulatory requirements. However, supply chain systems are changing through digitization. In digitized supply chains, data is shared with the relevant stakeholders through digital supply chain platforms, including blockchain technology. In such datadriven digital supply chains, the regulators may be able to leverage digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to automate the compliance verification process. However, a barrier to progress is the risk that information will not be credible, thus reversing the gains that automation could achieve. Automating compliance based on inaccurate data may compromise the safety and credibility of the agricultural supply chain, which discourages regulators and other stakeholders from adopting and relying on automation. Within this article we consider the challenges of digital supply chains when we describe parts of the compliance management process and how it can be automated to improve the operational efficiency of agricultural supply chains. We introduce assisted autonomy as a means to pragmatically automate the compliance verification process by combining the power of digital systems while keeping the human in-the-loop. We argue that autonomous compliance is possible, but that the need for human led inspection processes will never be replaced by machines, however it can be minimised through 'assisted autonomy'. © 2021 IEEE."",""Automation"; Blockchain; Compliance Management; Regulation; Smart Contracts;" Supply Chain"",""Agriculture"; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Compliance control; Supply chains; Agricultural supply chains; Block-chain; Business operation; Compliance management; Compliance verification; Digital supply chain; Food processors; Regulation; Transportation agencies; Verification process;" Smart contract""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Machine Learning (ML) offers huge potential for precise predictions of complex logistics processes. This paper shows the results of a perennial research for implementing a MLbased system, which predicts multimodal supply chains, detects upcoming disruptions and provides suitable actor-specific measures. Methodology: For each process of the considered supply chain an individual prediction model is developed, using four years historical data, about 50 identified features and various ML methods. The developed cross-actor ETA was linked with preventive measures based on expert knowledge. Both was integrated into a web-based prototype of a selflearning decision support system. Findings: Thanks to the development of different ML approaches, most reliable model configurations were identified for each process. Moreover, important insights were gained regarding the availability of required data as well as the potentials and challenges of using ML-based solutions for decision-making processes in logistics. Originality: The potentials from the use of ML for predicting supply chains has only been carried out for particular processes.

Therefore, a proper supply chain management is vital for business continuity. One of the most challenging parts of SCM is the contract negotiation, and one main aspect of the negotiation is to know the risk associated with each range of quantity agreed on. Currently Managers assess the quantity to be supplied based on a binary way of either full or 0 supply, This paper aims to assess the corresponding quantities risks of the suppliers on a multilayer basis. The proposed approach uses fuzzy logic as an artificial intelligence tool that would develop the verbal terms of managers into numbers to be dealt with. A company that produces fresh frozen vegetables and fruits in Egypt who faces the problem of getting the required quantities from the suppliers with a fulfilment rate of 33% was chosen to apply the proposed model. The model allowed the managers to have full view of risk in their supply chain effectively and decide their needed capacity as well as the negotiation terms with both suppliers and customers. Future work should be the use of more data in the fuzzy database and implement the proposed methodology in an another industry. © 2021 IEEE."",""Fuzzy Logic"; Risk Management;" Supplier Selection"",""Computer circuits"; Managers; Risk assessment; Risk management; Supply chain management; Artificial intelligence tools; Business continuity; Contract negotiation; Fuzzy-Logic; Management IS; Risks assessments; Risks management; Supplier selection; Supply-chain risks; Vegetables and fruits;" Fuzzy logic""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These papers were filtered using the Title abstract keywords principle. Further, more papers were found using the forward-backward referencing method. The finalized papers were then classified into eight categories. Findings: The previous papers in AI and BDA in SCRM were studied. These papers emphasized various modelling and application techniques for AI and BDA in making the supply chain (SC) more resilient. It was found that more research has been done into conceptual modelling rather than real-life applications. It was seen that the use of AI-based techniques and structural equation modelling was prominent. Practical implications: AI and BDA help build the risk profile, which will guide the decision-makers and risk managers make their decisions quickly and more effectively, reducing the risks on the SC and making it resilient. Other than this, they can predict the risks in disasters, epidemics and any further disruption. They also help select the suppliers and location of the various elements of the SC to reduce the lead times.

Disruptions that impede the flow of material through a supply chain that can also result in failure to deliver end goods are a significant category of risks. The consequence of the Covid-19 outbreak has led to shut down production in the supply chain system, resulting in significant impediments for many foreign supply-dependent enterprises. The constraints cause substantial disruptions of the supply chain, production delays, and supplier delays. In recent years, managing supply chain risks has been given more importance to protect supply chains from interruptions by forecasts and prevention. The effects of disruptions on logistics, costs, demand, profits, and inventory levels of the supply chain are analyzed. SVM is one of the most convenient and effective supervised learning algorithms commonly used for classification and regression challenges. This paper presents a modernistic machine learning model, multi-category support vector machines (MC-SVM) algorithm through training on selected samples. In order to abet MC-SVM model to perform well on imbalanced data, k-means clustering algorithm has been proposed to classify clusters of nodes at-disruption, which share similar interruption profiles and can find the relationships between the data object, provide massive information and contribute significantly to accelerating classification and prediction of the SVM model. Data from portfolios of different firms in pharmaceutical industry has been used to train the MC-SVM model which maps the economic performance of a firm to a certain type of supply chain disruption (SCD). The potentiality of this research will privilege better management of the supply chain and thus will permit a network to approach faster response times to the customer, lower costs in all respects of the chain and to the end customer terrific levels of stretch-ability, lower inventories throughout the chain, and diminished the bottleneck effect in the supply chain logistics. © IEOM Society International."",""K-means clustering"; Multi Category SVM; Supply Chain Disruption; Supply Chain Performance;" Supply Chain Sustainability"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The pervasiveness of internet of things, sensors, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and particularly digital manufacturing and digital supply chain management led to the formation and development of the digital economy. A digital device alters from an auxiliary tool to an essential production element when the cost of production is low and the needs for inventory is minimized, so that it can be used for different financial levels. In fact, the development of digital production systems and supply chain will not only affect how the supply chain is managed, but also will define the concurrency of the production with the other activities in product life-cycle. In this paper, the role of Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MEAM) on Digital Production Systems and supply chain management is investigated. It is discussed how MEAM is comparable to the other metal 3D printing methods, in terms of machine cost, printing and post-processing.

Therefore, it is important for financial service providers (FSPs) to differentiate between low- and high-quality SMEs to accurately forecast the credit risk. This study proposes a novel hybrid ensemble machine learning approach to forecast the credit risk associated with SMEs’ agriculture 4.0 investments in SCF. Two core approaches were used, i.e., Rotation Forest algorithm and Logit Boosting algorithm. Key variables influencing the credit risk of agriculture 4.0 investments in SMEs were identified and evaluated using data collected from 216 agricultural SMEs, 195 Leading Enterprises and 104 FSPs operating in African agriculture sector. Besides the classical measures of credit risk assessment without involving SCF, the findings indicate that current ratio, financial leverage, profit margin on sales and growth rate of the agricultural SME are the upmost important variables that SCF actors need to focus on, in order to accurately and optimistically forecast and alleviate credit risk. The output of our study provides useful guidelines for SMEs, as it highlights the conditions under which they would be seen as creditworthy by FSPs. On the other hand, this study encourages the wide application of SCF in financing agriculture 4.0 investments. Due to the model’s performance, credit risk forecasting accuracy is improved, which results in future savings and credit risk mitigation in agriculture 4.0 investments of SMEs in SCF.

To examine the effects of the shared information, this study considers a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one original equipment manufacturer (OEM), one brand store, and one platform, and investigates the relations between the forecast information and firms’ channel strategies. Our analysis reveals some interesting implications. First, the platform’s forecast information encourages the OEM to develop online business unless the brand store adopts the dual-channel strategy and the platform sets the revenue commission as zero, while it always increases the brand store’s willingness to adopt the dual-channel strategy. Moreover, the OEM’s online business hinders the platform to share the information if consumers’ acceptance for the brand in online channel is low. Interestingly, the brand store’s dual-channel strategy hinders the platform to share the information if consumers’ acceptance for the brand in online channel is high. Further, we find that when the brand store adopts the dual-channel strategy, the OEM’s online business always decreases the benefit of the forecast information for the brand store. However, when the OEM develops online business, the brand store’s dual-channel strategy sometimes increases the benefit of the forecast information for the OEM. In addition, we also conduct some numerical experiments to examine the impacts of the platform commission rate on these firms’ benefits from the information and find that the higher commission rate can increase the OEM’s benefit under certain conditions.

In particular, the steel industry, as an energy-intensive industry, is being urged to adopt digitalisation technology to achieve optimization and sustainable production. Industries are fortunate to showcase an opportunity to advance the supply chain towards sustainability to deal with such a crisis. It is acknowledged that digital technology like blockchain can provide intercession by discovering real-time problems to perform certain Sustainable Development Goals related to procurement, production and processing, logistics and transportation and the environment. However, the data structure which requires implementation by blockchain technology in the steel supply chain is restricted. Blockchain technology has the outstanding position to transform the supply chain. The main challenge is that tracing border activities in the steel supply chain has not well been monitored. The digital system is drastically required to develop advanced technology to handle the disruptions and build a resilient supply chain. Using blockchain technology can capture the goods movement across the entire supply chain to verify the quality and product provenance. Furthermore, the rapid technology innovation in the steel sector involves the continuous update of skills and personnel. This study aims to explore the role of blockchain technology in the steel supply chain industry, such as inter-organizational trust, data transparency and immutability, interoperability and product type, and social influence and behavioural intention. A qualitative research approach was adopted on exploring multiple-case studies. The study reveals that blockchain technology contributes to a resilient steel supply chain in reducing risks and uncertainties with its transparency and immutability function. In the future, an integrated technology implementation framework should be developed to deploy Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technology in manufacturing industries to accelerate the digital transformation. © The Authors, 2021.

Consequently, agri-food supply chains are becoming more intelligent, producing vast amounts of data and pushing the boundaries of the traditional food lifecycle. However, artificial intelligence (AI) for the extended agri-food supply chain is only beginning to emerge. This paper presents a short literature review of eighteen papers on the intelligent agri-food supply chain. The bibliometric analysis reveals key research clusters and current trends in the AI-enabled stages of food production, distribution, and sustainable consumption. The important advances of AI in traditional stages of production need to be expanded with intelligent planning for demand uncertainty and personalized needs of end-customers, storage optimization, waste reduction in the post-production phase (e.g., distribution and recycling), and boundary-spanning analytics. For theory, this work highlights mature areas for AI adoption in agri-food and identifies opportunities for future research in the extended agri-food supply chain. For practice, the review findings can inspire startups interested in extended agri-food ecosystems and incumbents in their pilot projects for the intelligent and sustainable digital transformation of agri-food. AI techniques can contribute to close the loop of sustainable agri-food supply chains. © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The supply chain aims to increase its efficiency by reducing costs without neglecting quality and service levels. The implementation of predictive performance evaluation systems as a management practice has increased in recent years because in addition to measuring the efficiency and effectiveness of processes under certain scenarios, it includes artificial intelligence techniques that anticipate future events and allow taking advantage of behavioral patterns of historical data and current information to identify risks and opportunities. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based performance measurement system to help predict purchasing behavior through the impact of attributes of the SCOR supply chain operations reference model. The SCOR level 1 indicators are used as a standard for benchmarking against other supply chains. The proposed model is applied through an illustrative case and, according to the results obtained, it facilitates performance prediction and allows scenario analysis. In addition, it is adaptive to any industry and cyclical in search of the desired result, therefore, it helps decision makers to anticipate situations under uncertainty parameters and conditions by determining through simulations the performance attributes with the greatest impact on purchasing and facilitating decision making. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."",""Fuzzy logic techniques"; Logistics KPIs; Models; Predictive performance measurement;" Supply chain"",""Competition"; Computer circuits; Efficiency; Fuzzy logic; Information management; Risk perception; Decisions makings; Fuzzy logic techniques; Its efficiencies; Logistic KPI; Operational excellence; Performance measurement system; Performance measurements; Predictive performance; Predictive performance measurement; Reducing costs;" Supply chains""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although supply chain 4.0 aims to improve supply chains' production systems and profitability, it is subject to different operational and disruptive risks. Operational risks are a big challenge in the cycle of supply chain 4.0 for controlling the demand and supply operations to produce and deliver products across IT systems. This paper proposes a voting classifier to identify the operational risks in the supply chain 4.0 based on a Sine Cosine Dynamic Group (SCDG) algorithm. Exploration and exploitation mechanisms of the basic Sine Cosine Algorithm (CSA) are adjusted and controlled by two groups of agents that can be changed dynamically during the iterations. External and internal features were collected and analyzed from different data sources of service level agreements and transaction data from various KSA firms to validate the proposed algorithm's efficiency. A balanced accuracy of 0.989 and a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.0476 were achieved compared with other optimization-based classifier techniques. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) andWilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed to show the superiority of the proposed SCDG algorithm. Thus, the experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed SCDG algorithm-based voting classifier. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The goal is to minimize the overall total cost in the supply chain, including production and inventory of the final product and by-product transfer costs, while meeting the stochastic demands. First, a natural formulation of the problem is proposed, and is solved using the Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method. The analysis of the gaps exhibits however quite large optimality gaps. To improve these optimality gaps, a plant location like reformulation for this integrated lot-sizing problem is developed. The analysis has been carried out again to evaluate both formulations’ performances in terms of the optimality gaps and computational times, both when items demands follow Gamma and Normal distributions. The analysis indicates that despite having a computational time of on average 1.7 times higher than the main formulation, the plant location reformulation provides better optimality gaps on average 22% improved and better ranges for upper and lower bounds under stochastic demands. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing."",""By-product"; Industrial symbiosis; Lot-sizing;" Sample average approximation"",""Artificial intelligence"; Location; Normal distribution; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Alternative raw material; Capacitated lot sizing problem; Industrial symbiosis; Lot sizing problems; Production and inventory; Sample average approximation; Two-stage supply chains; Upper and lower bounds;" Production control""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We propose a two-period dual-channel supply channel model, where the manufacturer sells its product in each period through its direct channel and an independent retail channel. Both channels implement preannounced pricing. The results show that the selling prices of both channels in the first period is higher than those in the second period, and the price rate of change in the retail channel is higher than that in the direct channel. It implies that the manufacturer adopts a deeper discount in the direct channel than the retailer does in the retail channel. The numerical analysis reveals that the impact of channel substitutability on the price rate of change in the retail channel is more significant than the direct channel. In addition, the channel substitutability is harmful for the retailer and the manufacturer. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing."",""Dual-channel supply chain"; Game theory;" Preannounced pricing"",""Artificial intelligence"; Costs; Manufacture; Supply chains; Direct channel; Dual channel supply chain; Pricing policy; Rate of change; Retail channel; Revenue management; Selling prices; Supply channels;" Sales""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Literature presents several performance evaluation systems based on multi-criteria methods and artificial intelligence. Among them, the systems based on artificial neural networks (ANN) excel due to their capacity of modeling non-linear relationships between metrics and allowing adaptations to a specific environment by means of historical performance data. These systems' accuracy depend directly on the adopted training algorithm, and no studies have been found that assess the efficiency of these algorithms when applied to supply chain performance evaluation. In this context, the present study evaluates four ANNs learning methods in order to investigate which one is the most adequate to deal with supply chain evaluation. The algorithms tested were Gradient Descendent Momentum, Levenberg-Marquardt, Quasi-Newton and Scale Conjugate Gradient. The performance metrics were extracted from SCOR®, which is a reference model used worldwide. The random sub-sampling cross-validation method was adopted to find the most adequate topological configuration for each model. A set of 80 topologies was implemented using MATLAB®. The prediction accuracy evaluation was based on the mean square error. For the four level 1 metrics considered, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm provided the most precise results. The results of correlation analysis and hypothesis tests reinforce the accuracy of the proposed models. Furthermore, the proposed computational models reached a prediction accuracy higher than previous approaches. © 2021 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

Traditionally, simulation-based technologies are used for such purposes. However, such methods can be expensive and under-performing when the solution space is too large to be adequately explored. Biologically inspired computing approaches such as swarm intelligence algorithms are uniquely suited to solve complex, exponential, vectorial problems, such as those posed by multi-product supply chains connected with a large and diverse customer base and transportation methods. Although swarm intelligence algorithms have been used to optimise supply chains before, there has been little work on formalising and optimising the layer-egg supply chain, or the supply chain of a perishable product—where same/similar products can be packaged to form different product offerings to seek optimised configurations for different buyers based on different pricing and cost structures. In this paper, we introduce two new Swarm Intelligence algorithms and use them to optimise the profits of participating suppliers in a real-world layer-egg supply chain using its operational data, trade network, and demand & supply models. Several swarm intelligence algorithms were discussed and their performance was compared.

Security in supply chain is challenging due to the inherent vulnerabilities and threats from any part of the system which can be exploited at any point within the supply chain. This can cause a severe disruption on the overall business continuity. Therefore, it is paramount important to understand and predicate the threats so that organization can undertake necessary control measures for the supply chain security. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) provides an intelligence analysis to discover unknown to known threats using various properties including threat actor skill and motivation, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedure (TT and P), and Indicator of Compromise (IoC). This paper aims to analyse and predicate threats to improve cyber supply chain security. We have applied Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyse and predict the threats based on the CTI properties. That allows to identify the inherent CSC vulnerabilities so that appropriate control actions can be undertaken for the overall cybersecurity improvement. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, CTI data is gathered and a number of ML algorithms, i.e., Logistic Regression (LG), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), are used to develop predictive analytics using the Microsoft Malware Prediction dataset. The experiment considers attack and TTP as input parameters and vulnerabilities and Indicators of compromise (IoC) as output parameters. The results relating to the prediction reveal that Spyware/Ransomware and spear phishing are the most predictable threats in CSC. We have also recommended relevant controls to tackle these threats.

The volume of data generated from all parts of the supply chain has changed the nature of SCM analysis. By increasing the volume of data, the efficiency and effectiveness of the traditional methods have decreased. Limitations of these methods in analyzing and interpreting a large amount of data have led scholars to generate some methods that have high capability to analyze and interpret big data. Therefore, the main purpose of this paper is to identify the applications of machine learning (ML) in SCM as one of the most well-known artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. By developing a conceptual framework, this paper identifies the contributions of ML techniques in selecting and segmenting suppliers, predicting supply chain risks, and estimating demand and sales, production, inventory management, transportation and distribution, sustainable development (SD), and circular economy (CE).

In fact, several important factors should be taken into account in the process of building an adaptive and reconfigurable supply chain. Reconfigurability is used to measure quantitatively the capability of supply chain to change easily their structure and functions. The aim of this work is to evaluate the level of reconfigurability of a supply chain. Quantitative measures of six indicators that characterize reconfigurability are presented in this paper. Then, an index of reconfigurability in supply chain is developed based on The Multi-Attribute Utility Theory in order to choose the most reconfigurable configuration. An illustrative example is also given. From the discussion, it is deduced that the characteristics of the reconfigurable supply chain impacts positively on the degree of reconfigurability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."",""Multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT)"; Reconfigurability assessment; Reconfigurability characteristics;" Reconfigurable supply chain (RSC)"",""Artificial intelligence"; Computer aided manufacturing; Software engineering; Agile supply chains; Market uncertainty; Multi-attribute utility theory; Quantitative measures; Reconfigurability; Reconfigurable;" Supply chains""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To that end, experts can evaluate the materials and give an accurate estimation for both aspects. In that case, one might wonder, why is a decision support system employing machine learning necessary? While a fully automated machine learning model rarely surpasses a human’s ability in such tasks, there are several advantages in employing one. For starters, human experts will be more expensive to employ, rather than use an algorithm. One could claim that research towards developing an efficient and fully automated decision support system would end up costing more than employing actual human experts. In this instance, it is paramount to think long-term. Investing in this kind of research will create systems which are reusable, extensible, and scalable. This aspect alone more than remedies the initial costs. It is also important to observe that, if the number of wastes to be processed is more than the human experts can process in a timely fashion, they will not be able to provide their services, even if employment costs were not a concern. On the contrary, a machine learning model is perfectly capable of scaling to humongous amounts of data, conducting fast data processing and decision making. For power plants with particularly fast processing needs, an automated decision support system is an important asset. Moreover, a decision support system can predict the future based on past observations. While not always entirely spot on, it can give a future estimation about aspects such as energy required, amounts of wastes produced etc. in the future. Therefore, processing plants can plan of time and adapt to specific needs. A human expert can provide this as well to some degree, but on a much smaller scale. Especially in time series forecasting, it is interesting to note that, even if a decision support model does not predict exact values, it is highly likely to predict trends of the value increasing or decreasing in certain ranges. In the next sections, we are going to describe the four machine learning models that were developed and which compose the Decision Support System of FENIX. Section 8.1 describes how we predict the quality of the extracted materials based on features such as temperature, extruder speed, etc. Section 8.2 describes the process of extracting heuristic rules based on existing results. Section 8.3 describes how FENIX provides time-series forecasting to predict the future of a variable based on past observations. Finally, Sect. 8.4 describes the process of classifying materials based on images. © 2021, The Author(s)."",,""Automation"; Data handling; Decision making; Forecasting; Machine learning; Supply chains; Time series; Turing machines; Accurate estimation; Circular economy; Decision support models; Employment costs; Fast Processing; Machine learning models; Processing plants; Time series forecasting;" Decision support systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The emergence of e-commerce has greatly shortened the time and space distance between economic participants and maximized the sharing of resources. However, the financial management and risk assessment capabilities of the existing supply are insufficient to adapt to the rapidly developing new environment. This article uses a combination of normative analysis and empirical analysis to analyze the status quo of the supply chain of small and medium e-commerce companies. First, this article establishes an evaluation framework for the supply chain of e-commerce companies based on edge computing. Second, according to the distribution of the supply chain, this article adds the member's predetermined quota, reputation, execution time, and other indicators as parameters to establish a fuzzy neural network model. On this basis, combined with the price regression model, the pricing plan is evaluated. The results show that the financing risk obtained by this model differs very little from the actual risk.

This review analyzes and addresses gaps in modeling supply chain resilience in general and specifically for vaccines in order to guide researchers and practitioners alike to improve critical function of vaccine supply chains in the face of inevitable disruptions. Design/methodology/approach: Systematic review of the literature on modeling supply chain resilience from 2007 to 2020 is analyzed in tandem with the vaccine supply chain manufacturing literature. These trends are then used to apply a novel matrix analysis to seven Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) annual filings of pharmaceutical corporations involved in COVID-19 vaccine manufacture and distribution. Findings: Pharmaceutical corporations favor efficiency as they navigate regulatory, economic and other threats to their vaccine supply chains, neglecting resilience – absorption, adaptation and recovery from inevitable and unexpected disruptions. However, explicitly applying resilience analytics to the vaccine supply chain and further leveraging emerging network science tools found in the academic literature, such as artificial intelligence (AI), stress tests and digital twins, will help supply chain managers to better quantify efficiency/resilience tradeoffs across all associated networks/domains and support optimal system performance post disruption.

Here, we take advantage of descriptive DM to detect and grasp important patterns among several features that coexist in a real-world automotive SC. Principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to analyse and understand the interrelations between ten quantitative and dependent variables in a multi-item/multi-supplier environment. Afterwards, the principal component scores are characterised via a K-means clustering, allowing us to classify the samples into four clusters and to derive different profiles for the multiple inventory items. This work provides evidence that descriptive DM contributes to find interesting feature-patterns, resulting in the identification of important risk profiles that may effectively leverage inventory management for improved SC performance.

Several start-ups have emerged in India trying to crack this globally yet unsolved problem statement. Moreover, the freight scene, being age old, has its segment of bottlenecks to deal with which are inclusive but not limited to problems like fragmentation, inflated costs, lack of visibility into lanes, limited digital capabilities and back hauling. Tech-driven start-ups provide solutions to overcome these challenges for the fleet owners in terms of optimized demand–supply matching, brokerage eliminations by connecting supply with relevant demand thereby reducing costs, expose truckers and fleet owners to unchartered lanes and also facilitate reverse loads to optimize costs for these businesses. This is where companies are leveraging data science and analytics to tackle these issues and help the businesses grow. Companies like Uber Freight, BlackBuck and Rivigo are using the best of technologies to monetize this industry. Data when logged in the right manner can help industries understand the intricacies of issues and help them overcome the same. A typical example of implementation would be using a simple regression technique to predict demand in a specific region so that supply can be exposed well within time in order to avoid idling period by these truckers. Tracking key metrics like supply turn around time (TAT), truck in transit duration (TiT), placement index and others can help organizations determine and optimize on these metrics to maximize revenue. Being convoluted of a system, this industry has been a tough nut to crack, especially in a country like India. This chapter discusses how companies set up the entire data platform and infrastructure, thereby facilitating the usage of data for advanced analytics techniques to solve some crucial supply chain problems in the freight industry. The chapter also talks about some of the use cases for analytics and machine learning to solve problems related to the freight industry. Firstly, we demonstrate some visualizations and representations as to how insights are drawn through analytics to solve these kinds of problems. We follow this up by discussing how data infrastructures are set up in organizations to collect freight data and then finally we showcase some ML techniques that are used in the freight sector of businesses.

In each simulation, the agents learn their pricing strategies using reinforcement learning. And we defined and calculated the new collusion metric representing how agents collude. Secondly, we tested cases with open and shield bidding with multiple numbers of agents. In our result, we observe that deep Q-Learning demonstrates the highest collusion metric.

However, most of the existing solutions cannot well meet the requirements of traceability and management in ASCs. To address these challenges, we first design a blockchain-based ASC framework to provide product traceability, which guarantees decentralized security for the agri-food tracing data in ASCs. Next, a Deep Reinforcement learning based Supply Chain Management (DR-SCM) method is proposed to make effective decisions on the production and storage of agri-food products for profit optimization. The extensive simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based framework and the DR-SCM method under different ASC environments.

Besides, the context of digitalization, integration, and globalization of the supply chain has raised an increasing awareness of advanced information processing techniques such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) in building SCRes and improving supply chain performance (SCP). The present study investigates the direct and indirect effects of AI, SCRes, and SCP under a context of dynamism and uncertainty of the supply chain. In doing so, we have conceptualized the use of AI in the supply chain on the organizational information processing theory (OIPT). The developed framework was evaluated using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. Survey data was collected from 279 firms representing different sizes, operating in various sectors, and countries. Our findings suggest that while AI has a direct impact on SCP in the short-term, it is recommended to exploit its information processing capabilities to build SCRes for long-lasting SCP.

Consumers' demand for experiential shopping has led to the formation of a new sales pattern, and the O2O sales model emphasizing experiential marketing has become a hot topic of common concern in the business and academic circles. The formulation of product quality level and sales service level strategies by enterprises is often affected by both consumers’ behaviors and supply chain members’ behaviors: On the one hand, considering the influence of the difference between the reference level and the actual experience level on consumer demand, this paper incorporates both the reference quality effect of online consumers and the reference service effect on offline channels into goodwill dynamics and demand function of consumers. On the other hand, supply chain members often do not comply with the assumption of “economic man” in traditional economics when they interact with each other, While they often have a certain social preference - reciprocity altruism, that is, they not only consider their own benefits, but also pay attention to each other's benefits to a certain extent. For this reason, this paper regards the utilities maximization of reciprocity altruism as the objectives of supply chain members when making decisions. To sum up, considering the inherent dynamics of supply chain operation and consumers’ reference effects in the supply chain system under O2O mode which is composed of a dominated manufacturer and a retailer selling through both online and offline, the differential game models among decentralized, centralized and reciprocal altruistic decision-making pattern are constructed by using differential game theory, manufacturer's quality level strategy, retailer's dominant service level strategy, and supply chain's profits and utilities are obtains among three decision-making modes. Through comparison, we find that: 1) The reference effects of consumers cause the “anchoring psychology”, which leads to manufacturers' lowering quality level, retailers' lowering service level, and also damages the performance of the product-service supply chain. 2) Consumer's channel preference has an important impact on supply chain members' strategies and performance. Retailers should encourage consumers to purchase products online and use offline channel services as sales assistance measures to satisfy consumers' experience utility. 3) Members' reciprocal altruistic behavior as a positive social preference can obtain Pareto improvement in supply chain performance compared with decentralized decision-making model. and also result in additional social benefits";" 4) If and only if both manufacturer and retailer have pure altruistic behavior preferences, i. e. the lowest return and the highest altruism, the total profit of supply chain can reach the situation of centralized decision-making. To this end, the management inspiration of this paper is: due to many management drawbacks of centralized decision-making, such as high management costs and difficulty in implementation, supply chain members should actively display the social preferences of mutual benefit and altruism, and deepen the vertical cooperation of supply chain on the basis of independent decision-making. On the one hand, manufacturer can improve product quality through product innovation, strictly control product quality to enhance brand goodwill, form quality identity and lay a good quality foundation for retailer sales links. On the other hand, retailer should undertake the sales link of supply chain to serve consumers' experience consumption: recommending personalized products to customers at lower cost through advanced technologies such as data mining, setting up 24-hour online customer service, solving customers' pre-sale doubts, reducing the adverse effects of reference service in online channel. While in offline channel, he can establish a reasonable membership system, take feedback promotion activities regularly and feed old customers to improve their retention rate and loyalty, even use word-of-mouth effect to attract new customers and tap new consumer market potential. Through the mutual benefits and altruism of manufacturer and retailer, the supply chain division of labor can be carried out to comprehensively improve the quality level and service capacity from the production end to the sales end, build brand goodwill, and promote win-win situation in all channels. © 2021.

However, the burning of coal produces dangerous gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. One alternative to decrease these emissions is biomass co-firing. To establish biomass as a viable option, the optimization of the biomass supply chain (BSC) is essential. Although most of the research conducted has focused on optimization models, the purpose of this paper is to incorporate machine-learning (ML) algorithms into a stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to select potential storage depot locations and improve the solution in two ways: By decreasing the total cost of the BSC and the computational burden. We consider the level of moisture and level of ash in the biomass from each parcel location, the average expected biomass yield, and the distance from each parcel to the closest power plant. The training labels (whether a potential depot location is beneficial or not) are obtained through the stochastic MILP model. Multiple ML algorithms are applied to a case study in the northeast area of the United States: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. After applying the hybrid methodology combining ML and optimization, it is found that the MLP outperforms the other algorithms in terms of selecting potential depots that decrease the total cost of the BSC and the computational burden of the stochastic MILP model. The LR and the DT also perform well in terms of decreasing total cost. © 2020 by the authors.

This disagreement extends from the modeling and optimization space to real-time event monitoring to projecting impacts and executing corrective actions. One type of resilience, that is of interest, is topological resilience, i.e. how is the downtime of a network node going to affect the network flow. In this paper, we propose a machine learning algorithm, based on using Hopfield Neural Nets as optimizers, to calculate one type of topological resilience for a supply chain network.

The erroneous data as inputs in the prediction process may produce inaccurate predictions. We aim to use machine learning models in the area of the business decision process by predicting products’ backorder while providing flexibility to the decision authority, better clarity of the process, and maintaining higher accuracy. A ranged method is used for specifying different levels of predicting features to cope with the diverse characteristics of real-time data which may happen by machine or human errors. The range is tunable that gives flexibility to the decision managers. The tree-based machine learning is chosen for better explainability of the model. The backorders of products are predicted in this study using Distributed Random Forest (DRF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). We have observed that the performances of the machine learning models have been improved by 20% using this ranged approach when the dataset is highly biased with random error. We have utilized a five-level metric to indicate the inventory level, sales level, forecasted sales level, and a four-level metric for the lead time. A decision tree from one of the constructed models is analyzed to understand the effects of the ranged approach.

By using an initial solution, known as """"warm start"""", the search space can be reduced to get more opportunity to find an optimal solution. The applicability of the proposed method was evaluated by using it to determine the optimal facility locations for a biomass supply chain problem using a real case study from Central Vietnam.

To date, the information management method for China's agricultural supply chain is usually stored in a centralized database and file system, with weak information management capabilities, leading to problems such as theft, tampering, deletion, and inconsistencies. In light of these problems, we introduce blockchain technology which is a cutting-edge technology in digital finance and has developed rapidly. This paper proposes a data management system based on blockchain technology and affords efficient data extraction, management and access control for heterogeneous forms of data across the agricultural supply chain. The data management system includes four credible data management platforms: agricultural production information, recording transportation information, farmer-consumer transaction information, and consumer credit information. It also can add more platforms according to later needs and combine an interstellar distributed file system and smart contract technology, making it possible to conduct information security research throughout the agricultural supply chain. The proposed system effectively protects information about supply chain activities including agricultural product production, warehousing, transportation, distribution, and sales. It implements seamless connection between agricultural product production and marketing, enabling the transforming and upgrading of agriculture, thereby helping farmers increase their income and eliminate poverty. © 2020 IEEE."",""Agricultural supply chain"; Blockchain; Data access; Data extraction; Data management;" Smart contract"",""Access control"; Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Blockchain; Data mining; File organization; Supply chain management; Supply chains; Agricultural productions; Agricultural supply chains; Centralized data-base; Cutting edge technology; Data management system; Distributed file systems; Management capabilities; Transaction information;" Information management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although the overarching aim of supply chain 4.0 is the enhancement of production systems within supply chains, making use of global reach, increasing agility and emerging technology, with the ultimate goal of increasing efficiency, timeliness and profitability, Supply chain 4.0 suffers from unique and emerging operational and cyber risks. Supply chain 4.0 has a lack of semantic standards, poor interoperability, and a dearth of security in the operation of its manufacturing and Information Technology processes. The technologies that underpin supply chain 4.0 include blockchain, smart contracts, applications of Artificial Intelligence, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things. Each of these technologies, individually and combined, create cyber security issues that should be addressed. This paper explains the nature of the military supply chains 4.0 and how it uniquely differs from the commercial supply chain, revealing their strengths, weaknesses, dependencies and the fundamental technologies upon which they are built. This encompasses an assessment of the cyber risks and opportunities for research in the field, including consideration of connectivity, sensing and convergence of systems.

Performance evaluation translates into key performance indicators (KPIs) with a high impact on increasing overall efficacy and efficiency. As the pool of KPIs has increased over time in the context of evaluating the supply chain management (SCM) system’s performance and assessing, communicating and managing its risks, a mathematical model based on neural networks has been developed. The SCM system has been structured into subsystems with the most relevant KPIs for set subsystems and their most important contributions on the increase in the overall SCM system performance and sustainability. As a result of the performed research based on the interview method, the five most relevant KPIs of each SCM subsystem and the most relevant problems are underlined. The main goal of this paper is to develop a performance evaluation model that links specific problems with the most relevant KPIs for every subsystem of the supply chain management. This paper demonstrates that by using data mining, the relationship between certain problems that appear in the supply chain management of every company and specific KPIs can be identified. The paper concludes with a graphical user interface (GUI) based on neural networks using the multilayer perceptron artificial intelligence algorithm where the most trustworthy KPIs for each selected problem can be predicted. This aspect provides a highly innovative contribution in solving supply chain management problems provided by organizations by allowing them to holistically track, communicate, analyze and improve the SCM system and ensure overall system sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

The performance of the CTFF is evaluated on point-of-sales data from a large multi-channel retail supply chain. Through several performance metrics and statistical tests, we conclude that forecasts from the CTFF are significantly better than the direct forecasts. In addition, improvements are significant and consistent across cross-sectional and temporal levels of a supply chain.

Among the most commonly used biomass feedstock is corn stover, corn residue remaining in the fields after harvesting. One of the biggest challenges of using corn stover as biomass feedstock is that burning it in field is the fastest and cheapest way for many growers so as to remove it and grow new crops. This leftover corn stover could be, instead, converted to bioethanol. In this work, we propose a decision support system for expanding existing biorefineries or building new ones to help stakeholders design a supply chain network model that converts all of the available corn stover to bioethanol. Two configurations presented in this study which is the existing plant expansion (EP) configuration and the combination of existing and new plant configuration (ENP), by exploring the incentive and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission price value for the bioenergy plant to achieve the goal.

Every actor holds its own set of information and attempts to maximize its objective (minimizing costs/minimizing inventory holdings) based on the available settings. Therefore, the agents control their own activities with the objective of improving their own competitiveness, which leads them to make decisions that maximize their local performance by ignoring the other agents or even the final consumer. These decisions are myopic because they do not consider the performance of all the partners to satisfy the consumer. Demand Forecasting and Order Planning in Supply Chains and Humanitarian Logistics is a collection of innovative research that focuses on demand anticipation, forecasting, and order planning as well as humanitarian logistics to propose original solutions for existing problems. While highlighting topics including artificial intelligence, information sharing, and operations management, this book is ideally designed for supply chain managers, logistics personnel, business executives, management experts, operation industry professionals, academicians, researchers, and students who want to improve their understanding of supply chain coordination in order to be competitive in the new era of globalization. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Its composition depends on reservoir location and in situ conditions and changes once crude oil is spilled into the environment, making the characteristics associated with every spill unique. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are common components of the crude oil and constitute a group of persistent organic pollutants. Due to their highly hydrophobic, and their low solubility tend to accumulate in soil and sediment. The process by which oil is sourced and made available for use is referred to as the oil supply chain and involves three parts: (1) upstream, (2) midstream and (3) downstream activities. As consequence from oil supply chain activities, crude oils are subjected to biodeterioration, acidification and souring, and oil spills are frequently reported affecting not only the environment, but also the economy and human resources. Different bioremediation techniques based on microbial metabolism, such as natural attenuation, bioaugmentation, biostimulation are promising approaches to minimize the environmental impact of oil spills. The rate and efficiency of this process depend on multiple factors, like pH, oxygen content, temperature, availability and concentration of the pollutants and diversity and structure of the microbial community present in the affected (contaminated) area. Emerging approaches, such as (meta-)taxonomics and (meta-)genomics bring new insights into the molecular mechanisms of PAH microbial degradation at both single species and community levels in oil reservoirs and groundwater/seawater spills. We have scrutinized the microbiological aspects of biodegradation of PAHs naturally occurring in oil upstream activities (exploration and production), and crude oil and/or by-products spills in midstream (transport and storage) and downstream (refining and distribution) activities. This work addresses PAH biodegradation in different stages of oil supply chain affecting diverse environments (groundwater, seawater, oil reservoir) focusing on genes and pathways as well as key players involved in this process. In depth understanding of the biodegradation process will provide/improve knowledge for optimizing and monitoring bioremediation in oil spills cases and/or to impair the degradation in reservoirs avoiding deterioration of crude oil quality. © Copyright © 2020 Hidalgo, Sierra-Garcia, Dellagnezze and de Oliveira."",""bioremediation"; groundwater; oils reservoirs; PAH;" sea water"",""chrysene"; cyclic GMP; gasoline; muconic acid; petroleum derivative; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; quercetin; RNA 16S; sea water; acidification; Alphaproteobacteria; Bacteroidetes; Basidiomycetes; Betaproteobacteria; biodegradation; bioinformatics; bioremediation; community dynamics; Cupriavidus; cyanobacterium; DNA extraction; environmental factor; fermentation; Flavobacterium; gene sequence; high throughput sequencing; intestine flora; machine learning; metagenome; metagenomics; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial consortium; microbial degradation; microbial diversity; microbiome; nonhuman; particulate matter; pH; phytoplankton; Proteobacteria; proteomics; pyrosequencing; Review; Rhodobacteraceae; Shewanella; soil pollution; solid waste management; ubiquitination;" waste water management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is apparent that changes in- and outside the aquaculture supply chain may act as driving forces for the introduction of food safety hazards. Knowledge on these drivers of change and their impact in the various steps in the food supply chain may help food producers to mitigate to potential risks and maintain high-quality food. Scope and approach: In this study, we analysed the use of expert driven methodologies to assess and predict the effect of drivers of change on selected food/feed safety vulnerabilities in the salmon aquaculture supply chain of Norway. The presented overview is based on the findings of the “Aquarius” project, which was funded by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Key findings and conclusions: In this study, over 100 experts were involved and various expert elicitation methods were applied such as on-line questionnaires, interviews, Delphi and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA). This approach resulted in a comprehensive overview of the Norwegian salmon supply chain. For each step in the supply chain, vulnerabilities for human and animal health were identified, which were prioritised by FMEA. For the two highest-ranked vulnerabilities in each step of the supply chain, drivers were identified and prioritised by expert elicitation in a Delphi study. Also, indicators and linked data sources were obtained for the highest-ranked drivers. The comprehensive information collected was integrated in a Bayesian Network (BN) model that links data sources for indicators and drivers of change. The applicability of the BN model was demonstrated for salmon health for four vulnerabilities and three steps in Atlantic salmon aquaculture.

In addition to known inefficiencies caused by the bullwhip effect within a supply chain product flow, such as excessive inventory, it can also lead to inefficiencies in cash flow such as the cash flow bullwhip (CFB). The CFB reduces the efficiency of the supply chain (SC) through heterogeneous distribution of cash among supply chain members. This paper aims to decrease both the BWE and the CFB across a SC through applying a simulation-based optimisation approach, which integrates system dynamics (SD) simulation and genetic algorithms.

Sourcing risk has primarily focused on short-term mitigation. This paper aims to offer an approach that uses newsfeed data to assess regional supply base risk in LCC’s for the apparel sector, which managers can use to plan for future risk on a long-term planning horizon. Design/methodology/approach: This paper demonstrates that the bulk of supplier risk assessments focus on short-term responses to disruptions in developed countries, revealing a gap in assessments of long-term risks for supply base expansion in LCCs. This paper develops an approach for predicting and planning for long-term supply base risk in LCC’s to address this shortfall. A machine-based learning algorithm is developed that uses the analysis of competing hypotheses heuristic to convert data from multiple news feeds into numerical risk scores and visual maps of supply chain risk. This paper demonstrates the approach by converting large amounts of unstructured data into two measures, risk impact and risk probability, leading to visualization of country-level supply base risks for a global apparel company. Findings: This paper produced probability and impact scores for 23 distinct supply base risks across 10 countries in the apparel sector. The results suggest that the most significant long-term risks of supply disruption for apparel in LCC’s are human resource regulatory risks, workplace issues, inflation costs, safety violations and social welfare violations. The results suggest that apparel brands seeking suppliers in the regions of Cambodia, India, Bangladesh, Brazil and Vietnam should be aware of the significant risks in these regions that may require mitigative action. Originality/value: This approach establishes a novel approach for objectively projecting future global sourcing risk, and yields visually mapped outcomes that can be applied in forecasting and planning for future risks when considering sourcing locations in LCC’s. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""Buyer-seller relationships"; Industrial purchasing; Machine learning; Supplier relationships; Supply base risk analysis; Supply chain disruptions; Supply chain ethics; Supply chain risk; Supply risk;" Sustainability"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this context, companies are increasingly held accountable for social and ecological issues that lie within the sphere of action of their suppliers and sub-suppliers. They are thus faced with the challenge of meeting these demands for transparency, traceability, and compliance with standards in their Supply Chains (SCs). Based on the theoretical framework of Sustainable Supply Chain Transparency (SSCT) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), this conceptual article aims at initiating the discussion on digitalization in SSCM. Therefore, a heuristical research framework, based on relevant fields in the management of sustainability oriented transparency (governance, cooperation and partner selection, traceability/tracking, and strategic and operational risk assessment) is developed. In relation to these fields, consequently, data-driven digital approaches are identified to which potentials for SSCT and control can be attributed. This initial analysis of existing digital approaches already shows that the market is developing dynamically, but is driven more by individual initiatives. In many cases, the approaches used so far are still in the trial phase or offer only limited solutions. Therefore, this paper contributes by giving an overview of the current application of the digitalization approaches in SSCM pinning our discussion on SSCT dimensions. © 2020 by the authors."",""Artificial intelligence"; Blockchain technology; Cloud-computing; Data-driven technologies; Sustainable supply chain management;" Sustainable supply chain transparency"",""compliance"; digital image; digitization; heuristics; human rights; market development; supply chain management; sustainability;" theoretical study""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The ability to detect disruptions early can help improve the resilience of the supply chain. In this paper, the application of principal component analysis (PCA) and dynamic PCA (DPCA) in fault detection and diagnosis of a supply chain system is investigated. In order to monitor the supply chain, data such as inventory levels, market demands, and amount of products in transit are collected. PCA and DPCA are used to model the normal operating conditions (NOC). Two monitoring statistics, the Hotelling's T2 and the squared prediction error (SPE), are used to detect abnormal operation of the supply chain. The confidence limits of these two statistics are estimated from the training data based on the χ2-distributions. The contribution plots are used to identify the variables with abnormal behavior when at least one statistic exceeds its limit. Two case studies are presented - a multi-echelon supply chain for a single product that includes a manufacturing process and a gas bottling supply chain with multiple products. In order to validate the proposed method, supply chain simulation models are developed using the programming language Python 3.7, and simulated data is collected for analysis. PCA and DPCA are applied to the data using the scikit-learn machine learning library for Python. The results show that abnormal operation due to transportation delay, supply shortage, and poor manufacturing yield can be detected.

Further, many industries have limited access to professional commercial optimization solvers or computational power for use in their day-to-day operational decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with the issue of solving large operational stochastic optimization problems (SOPs) by using machine learning models. We assume that decision makers have access to facilities to optimally solve their large-scale optimization model for some initial and limited period and for some test instances. This might be through a collaborative project with research institutes or through short-term use of high-performance computing facilities. We propose that longer term support can be provided by utilizing the solutions (i.e., the optimal value of the actionable decision variables) of the stochastic optimization model from this initial period to train a machine learning model to learn optimal operational decisions in the future. In this study, the proposed approach is employed to make decisions on transshipment of blood units in a network of hospitals. We compare the decisions learned by several machine learning models with the optimal results obtained if the hospitals had access to commercial optimization solvers and computational power, and with the hospital network's current empirical heuristic policy. The results show that using a trained neural network model reduces the average daily cost by about 29% compared with current policy, while the exact optimal policy reduces the average daily cost by 37%. Although optimization models cannot be fully replaced by machine learning, our proposed approach while not guaranteed to be optimal can improve operational decisions when optimization models are computationally expensive and infeasible for daily operational decisions in organizations such as not-for-profit and small and medium-sized enterprises. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"",""Blood supply chain"; CART; Data mining; k-NN; Large-Scale optimization; Machine learning; Neural networks;" Perishable inventory management"",""Blood"; Constrained optimization; Data mining; Decision making; Hospitals; Inventory control; Learning systems; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Supply chain management; Blood supply; CART; High performance computing; Large-scale optimization; Perishable inventory management; Small and medium sized enterprise; Stochastic optimization model; Stochastic optimization problems;" Stochastic models""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, a range of risks relating to food safety and product fraud requires this industry to develop an effective traceability solution. In response to this biometric identification techniques are seen as a possible solution to provide greater security compared to the current tag-based tracking systems. This paper describes how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used in conjunction with image processing techniques to enable an autonomic grading solution in the SRL supply chain. The research is an essential part of an overall investigation into designing a low-cost biometric identification solution for tracking lobsters along their supply chain from catch to table. By using a CNN, the research aims to improve the previous research on lobster grading in establishing a reliable and flexible traceability method to meet different supply chain contexts. In this approach, a pre-trained Mask-RCNN model was adopted to extract regions of interest from lobster images. The deep learning ability of this model allows the carapace areas to be segmented from lobster images automatically for calculating grading attributes including size, weight and colour. This outcome then also generates a high-quality input dataset for the follow-up research on identifying individual lobsters. To prove the effectiveness, the proposed method was validated on a large image dataset collected at a lobster processor and tested on mobile application environment.

The controlled processes range from rather simple traffic lights and elevators to complex networks of ICS in car manufacturing or controlling nuclear power plants. With the advent of industrial Ethernet ICS are increasingly connected to networks of Information Technology (IT). Thus, novel attack vectors on ICS are possible. In IT networks information hiding and steganography is increasingly used in advanced persistent threats to conceal the infection of the systems allowing the attacker to retain control over the compromised networks. In parallel ICS are more and more a target for attacks as well. Here, simple automated attacks as well as targeted attacks of nation state actors with the intention of damaging components or infrastructures as a part of cyber crime have already been observed. Information hiding could bring such attacks to a new level by integrating backdoors and hidden/covert communication channels that allow for attacking specific processes whenever it is deemed necessary. This paper sheds light on potential attack vectors on Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) using OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) network protocol based communication. We implement an exemplary supply chain attack consisting of an OPC UA server (Bob, B) and a Siemens S7-1500 PLC as OPC UA client (Alice, A). The hidden storage channel is using source timestamps to embed encrypted control sequences allowing for setting digital outputs to arbitrary values. The attack is solely relying on the programming of the PLC and does not require firmware level access. Due to the potential harm to life caused by attacks on cyber-physical systems any presentation of novel attack vectors need to present suitable mitigation strategies. Thus, we investigate potential approaches for the detection of the hidden storage channel for a warden W as well as potential countermeasures in order to increase the warden-compliance. Our machine learning based detection approach using a One-Class-Classifier yields a detection performance of 89.5% with zero false positives within an experiment with 46,159 OPC UA read responses without a steganographic message and 7,588 OPC UA read responses with an embedded steganographic message. © 2020 Owner/Author."",""industrial control systems"; information hiding; OPC UA; process automation;" steganography"",""Automotive industry"; Complex networks; Computer architecture; Control systems; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Firmware; Network architecture; Network protocols; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Programmable logic controllers; Supply chains; Detection approach; Detection performance; Industrial control systems; Industrial Ethernets; Information hiding; Mitigation strategy; One-class classifier; Opc unified architectures;" Process control""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we discuss the application of data analytics in predicting first tier supply chain disruptions using historical data available to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Our methodology includes three phases: First, an exploratory phase is conducted to select and engineer potential features that can act as useful predictors of disruptions. This is followed by the development of a performance metric in alignment with the specific goals of the case study to rate successful methods. Third, an experimental design is created to systematically analyse the success rate of different algorithms, algorithmic parameters, on the selected feature space. Our results indicate that adding engineered features in the data, namely agility, outperforms other experiments leading to the final algorithm that can predict late orders with 80% accuracy. An additional contribution is the novel application of machine learning in predicting supply disruptions. Through the discussion and the development of the case study we hope to shed light on the development and application of data analytics techniques in the analysis of supply chain data.

In recent years, with the deep integration of supply chain and Internet, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Blockchain, etc., the efficiency of supply chain financial services can be greatly promoted through building more customized risk pricing models and conducting more rigorous investment decision-making processes. However, with the rapid development of new technologies, the SCF data has been massively increased and new financial fraud behaviors or patterns are becoming more covertly scattered among normal ones. The lack of enough capability to handle the big data volumes and mitigate the financial frauds may lead to huge losses in supply chains. In this article, a distributed approach of big data mining is proposed for financial fraud detection in a supply chain, which implements the distributed deep learning model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on big data infrastructure of Apache Spark and Hadoop to speed up the processing of the large dataset in parallel and reduce the processing time significantly. By training and testing on the continually updated SCF dataset, the approach can intelligently and automatically classify the massive data samples and discover the fraudulent financing behaviors, so as to enhance the financial fraud detection with high precision and recall rates, and reduce the losses of frauds in a supply chain. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

The SMEs also obtain parts from many other dispersed suppliers, some of whom act as sole sources of critical parts, leading to the creation of complex supply chain networks. These characteristics necessitate having a high degree of visibility into the flow of parts through the networks to facilitate decision making for OEMs and SMEs, alike. However, such visibility is typically restricted in real-world operations due to limited information exchange among the buyers and suppliers. Therefore, we need an alternate mechanism to acquire this kind of visibility, particularly for critical prediction problems, such as purchase orders deliveries and sales orders fulfillments, together referred as work orders completion times. In this paper, we present one such surrogate mechanism in the form of supervised learning, where ensembles of decision trees are trained on historical transactional data. Furthermore, since many of the predictors are categorical variables, we apply a dimension reduction method to identify the most influential category levels. Results on real-world supply chain data show effective performance with substantially lower prediction errors than the original completion time estimates. In addition, we develop a web-based visibility tool to facilitate the real-time use of the prediction models. We also conduct a structured usability test to customize the tool interface. The testing results provide multiple helpful suggestions on enhancing the ease-of-use of the tool. © 2020 by ASME."",""Data-driven engineering"; Engineering informatics; Machine learning for engineering applications;" Manufacturing planning"",""Decision making"; Decision trees; Forecasting; Purchasing; Sales; Supply chains; Trees (mathematics); Visibility; Categorical variables; Degree of visibility; Dimension reduction method; Effective performance; Original equipment manufacturers; Real world operations; Small and medium scale enterprise; Supply chain systems;" Predictive analytics""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The considered two-stage supply chain includes manufacturers, distribution centers, and customers, and its principal feature is that in addition to the variable transportation costs, we have fixed costs for the opening of the distribution centers, as well as associated with the routes. In this paper, we describe a different approach for solving the problem, which is an effective hybrid genetic algorithm. Our proposed hybrid genetic algorithm is constructed to fit the challenges of the investigated supply chain network design problem, and it is achieved by incorporating a linear programming optimization problem within the framework of a genetic algorithm. Our achieved computational results are compared with the existing solution approaches on a set of 150 benchmark instances from the literature and on a set of 50 new randomly generated instances of larger sizes.

Counterfeit drugs are analyzed as a very big challenge for the pharmaceutical industry worldwide. As indicated by the statistics, yearly business loss of around $200 billion is reported by US pharmaceutical companies due to these counterfeit drugs. These drugs may not help the patients to recover the disease but have many other dangerous side effects. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey report, in under-developed countries every 10th drug use by the consumers is counterfeit and has low quality. Hence, a system that can trace and track drug delivery at every phase is needed to solve the counterfeiting problem. The blockchain has the full potential to handle and track the supply chain process very efficiently. In this paper, we have proposed and implemented a novel blockchain and machine learning-based drug supply chain management and recommendation system (DSCMR). Our proposed system consists of two main modules: blockchain-based drug supply chain management and machine learning-based drug recommendation system for consumers. In the first module, the drug supply chain management system is deployed using Hyperledger fabrics which is capable of continuously monitor and track the drug delivery process in the smart pharmaceutical industry. On the other hand, the N-gram, LightGBM models are used in the machine learning module to recommend the top-rated or best medicines to the customers of the pharmaceutical industry. These models have trained on well known publicly available drug reviews dataset provided by the UCI: an open-source machine learning repository. Moreover, the machine learning module is integrated with this blockchain system with the help of the REST API. Finally, we also perform several tests to check the efficiency and usability of our proposed system. © 2020 by the authors."",""Blockchain"; Drug supply chain; Healthcare; Hyperledger fabrics; Machine learning;" Smart contract"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Using this as a backdrop, we then distil the likely impact of the BRI on location decisions and supply chain flows. Finally, in a broader discussion of the SCM literature, we explore the implications of the BRI for future research in four key areas: supply chain configuration, supply chain resilience, sustainable SCM, and cross border SCM. While these areas are not new, the BRI presents a unique context that can be used to enhance theory and understanding in each area. The BRI reduces time distance independent of geographical distance by diverting supply chain flows from established routes to new routes via far less accessible regions. This introduces new risks and sustainability issues that call for multi-criteria decision support systems. Another important issue is the adoption and diffusion of the BRI since this will ultimately determine project success. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."",""Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)"; global manufacturing; global supply chain; supply chain design;" supply chain management"",""Artificial intelligence"; Decision support systems; Geographical regions; Highway administration; Roads and streets; Global manufacturing; Global supply chain; Global supply chain management; Multi-criteria decision support systems; Supply chain configuration; Supply chain design; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain resiliences;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It aims to understand the special properties of the GSCM system under the moderating effects of product complexity and purchasing structure. Design/methodology/approach: A thorough literature review led to the building of the conceptual framework. Six constructs were identified using systems theory. These constructs include green supply chain technological dimensions (particularly, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based), green supply chain strategy, green supply chain process, product complexity, purchasing structure, and firm performance. The instrument was scientifically developed for gathering survey responses using complete design test methods. The conceptual model was eventually tested based on survey data collected from 250 automotive components and allied manufacturers in the emerging economy of South Africa. Findings: The results indicate that GSCM technological dimensions (AI-based) positively influence GSCM strategy. Further, GSCM strategy was found to positively influence the GSCM process. The GSCM processes have significant effects on environmental performance, social performance, and financial performance. The product complexity has a significant moderation effect on the paths GSCM strategy and GSCM process. Originality/value: The findings from multivariate data analysis provide a better understanding of GSCM system dynamics and are helpful to key decision-makers.

Demand unpredictability is one of the managers’ concerns in the supply chain that can cause large forecasting errors, issues in the upstream supply chain and impose unnecessary costs. We investigate 843 real demand time series with different values of coefficient of variations (CoV) where promotion causes volatility over the entire demand series. In such a case, forecasting demand for different CoV require different models to capture the underlying behavior of demand series and pose significant challenges due to very different and diverse demand behavior. We decompose demand into baseline and promotional demand and propose a hybrid model to forecast demand. Our results indicate that our proposed hybrid model generates robust and accurate forecast and robust inventory performance across series with different levels of volatilities. We stress the necessity of decomposition for volatile demand series. We also model demand series with a number of well known statistical and machine learning (ML) models to investigate their forecast accuracy and inventory performance empirically. We found that ARIMA with covariate (ARIMAX) works well to forecast volatile demand series, but exponential smoothing with covariate (ETSX) has a poor performance. Support vector regression (SVR) and dynamic linear regression (DLR) models generate robust forecasts across different categories of demands with different CoV values. In terms of inventory performance, ARIMAX and combination models have superior performance to the other presented models. The hybrid algorithm also depicts robust performance across different series with different CoVs and has low inventory costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"",""Demand volatility"; Forecasting models; Inventory performance; Promotions;" Robust forecasts"",""Cobalt alloys"; Supply chains; Support vector regression; Coefficient of variation; Demand unpredictabilities; Demand volatility; Exponential smoothing; Forecasting models; Inventory performance; Promotions; Support vector regression (SVR);" Forecasting""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Transportation scheduling of vehicle and transportation nodes in supply chain management is an important factor in order to create a stable chained network by ensuring the highest amount of product distribution and lowest logistics cost.In recent years, a number of programming models like linear programming, heuristics and meta-heuristics optimization approaches are proposed by the researchers to solve this combinatorial NP-hard problem. In this paper, we have studied and analyzed the nature of transportation vehicle scheduling problem in a supply chain network with the help of third-party logistics enterprise by using a meta-heuristic algorithm called chemical reaction optimization (CRO). At first, we have classified all the transportation nodes into three distinct classifications. Then, a collaborative transportation scheduling strategy is used which is based on two significant kinds of transportation nodes. For the first two kinds of nodes, we have randomly created a large number of combined transportation routes, and the vehicle scheduling for the last standalone nodes is created by a random matrix generation. Then, we have proposed a CRO algorithm using four reaction operators with an additional repair operator to find out the best transportation routes within shortest computing time. We named our proposed algorithm as chemical reaction optimization for supply chain management (CRO-SCM). The proposed CRO-SCM algorithm is analyzed with the standard dataset from the proposed model using modified ACO-NSO algorithm which is the state of the art. In addition, a random dataset of different scales of transportation nodes is considered to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithm. Moreover, six different scales of problem sets consisting different number of nodes are adopted to analyze the performance of the proposed CRO algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical and efficient than existing ACO-based solutions and the experimental results are more efficient and optimal. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."",""Chemical reaction optimization"; Collaborative transportation scheduling; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Random matrix generation; Supply chain management;" Third-party logistics"",""Ant colony optimization"; Artificial intelligence; Chemical analysis; Chemical reactions; Computational complexity; Heuristic algorithms; Linear programming; Matrix algebra; Outsourcing; Random number generation; Scheduling; Transportation routes; Vehicles; Chemical-reaction optimizations; Collaborative strategies; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristics algorithms; Random matrix generations; Third party logistics; Third party logistics enterprise; Transportation vehicles;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The uncertain carbon price places significant effects on the establishment and operation of the whole supply chain. This study develops a green supply chain model combined with geographic information system (GIS) to account for carbon price uncertainty and evaluate its effects on the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) of plastic recycling. A two-stage stochastic programming model is constructed, in which the stochastic variable, CO2 price is modelled as a geometric Brownian motion process. Six scenarios are designed with respect to price expectation and volatility. A case study is performed with the GIS information of the plastic supply chain in Zhejiang province, China. The results illustrate that triggering the establishment of reverse logistics requires a carbon price threshold significantly beyond the current level. Lower price volatility would facilitate the decision-making of investment into the reverse logistics. Mechanisms to alleviate the market variation shall be introduced. A sound market condition is desired to obtain the optimal balance that encourages the CLSC without creating extra pressure on the firms. The proposed modelling framework can be easily applied to other sectors with similar characteristics. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."",""circular economy"; decision support systems; emissions trading; green supply chain; reverse logistics;" uncertainty"",""Artificial intelligence"; Brownian movement; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Decision making; Decision support systems; Geographic information systems; Investments; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Circular economy; Emissions Trading; Green supply chain; Reverse logistics; uncertainty;" Plastic recycling""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This new era entirely relies on the dynamic advantages of competition and the role played by the collaboration policy. A global economy and increasing demand have put a huge pressure on supply chain partners to build a collaboration policy based on price, order quantity, and advertising. Companies are adopting the idea of ”shaking hands” to obtain more profit instead of taking risks through competition. Cooperative (co-op) advertising is a significant policy of centralized supply chain management (SCM) to boost the revenues generated by the supplier, manufacturer, and retailers. The uncertain costs associated with the supply chain management also create obstacles in economic analysis and feasibility. These uncertainties are associated with the basic costs of all supply chain partners, which are represented using a signed distance formula. This paper develops the concept of co-op advertising among the supplier, manufacturer, and retailers with a variable demand driven by selling price and advertising costs, where all basic costs are considered as fuzzy. The profit is optimized by considering variable cycle time, shipments, pricing and advertising costs for the decision support system of the supply chain management. The optimal results of the co-op advertisement ensured an increase in the revenue of whole supply chain. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."",""Advertisement cost"; Collaboration policy; Fuzzy costs; Supply chain management;" Three-echelon supply chain"",""Artificial intelligence"; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Decision support systems; Economic analysis; Manufacture; Profitability; Risk management; Sales; Advertisement costs; Centralized supply chains; Collaboration policies; Cooperative advertisings; Fuzzy cost; Supply chain partners; Three-echelon; Uncertain condition;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we propose a belief-desire-intention modeling approach to predict suppliers' behavior and provide inspection suggestions to buyers to overcome the problem. Assuming access to the production process, our approach can represent suppliers' knowledge of production and deception to mimic their reasoning processes and predict their deception intentions. This flexible approach can also adapt to environmental changes and deliver effective results.

At present every nation is preparing itself to fight against the humanitarian emergency of COVID 19 which have led to risk of lives of the frontline workers. Around the world steady progress is being made to increase the connectivity of health care infrastructure. Every nation is working hard towards making infrastructure available to tackle the communicable diseases and prevent further emergence of pandemic like this in future. Several technologies are being used to combat COVID 29 such as artificial intelligence for research, 5G to increase information transmission speed, and more. To prevent the health workers from getting infected it is required to take special precautions while providing treatments to the infected patients. With rapid increase in number of cases of Covid19 infected patients there is a huge demand for the Personal protective equipment (PPE) kits - a protective shield for the health workers, all over the world. Increasing demand poses various challenges like malpractices of black marketing, circulation of cheaper and sub standardized commodities and subjective price hike. Most of the malpractices are impacting the sale of these kits as well. Block chain technology can play an important role in helping governments and institutions respond to COVID-19 by integrating with healthcare and supply chains.

Digital image processing can use specific geometric and optical properties of parts and components for determining their type and thus needs no external markers. It is thus well applicable to supply chain processes that involve direct handling of many different product components and need no individual identification of items. An example of such a process is counting items of different product types during packing. In this paper, we use deep learning-based digital image processing methods in order to distinguish and count the number of objects of two different types of automotive components in standardized transport bins, detected by time-of-flight (ToF) depth sensors. Classical watershed object counting methods are adapted to depth data and support the fast generation of training data for the deep learning-based classification methods. The proposed method is applied to an automotive supply chain, and it is demonstrated that car components can be counted with good reliability during packing into transport bins. Thus, digital image processing can be useful to supplement auto-identification and sensor technologies and complete digital end-to-end monitoring of supply chains. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Because of this, most of the industries are failing to accurately forecast the demand. This leads to increased manufacturing cost, higher inventory level, longer replenishment lead times, low product availability, higher transportation cost and overall, it reduces the supply chain profitability. Previous studies have proposed different methods to overcome the Bullwhip effect such as improving demand forecasting, reducing order batching, reducing the incentives of forward buying, better sharing of information, shorten lead and review period times and designing single-stage replenishment control. This study focuses on the customer-centric approach of categorizing the customers by incorporating Machine Learning techniques for better understanding the customers’ purchasing behavior. Specifically, this study analyzes the hidden patterns and similarities that exist between different customers and the products that they purchase. For the analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction and k-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning technique is used for customer categorization. By this, the end customer demands are tracked downstream from upstream in the supply chain, which may help to reduce the demand variation.

It is very difficult to forecast the sporadic demand because of the irregularities present in this type of dataset. This ultimately reduces the overall supply chain performance.

However, none of these methods considers the factors behind the irregularities present in sporadic datasets. Principal component analysis (PCA), an artificial intelligence algorithm, can analyze a dataset of two or more variables and observations are explained by distinct inter-correspond variables.

Fortunately, although credit-related information of SMEs is hard to be acquired sufficiently, the interactive relationships between SMEs, which may contain valuable information of financial risk, is usually available for the online financial institutions. Finding out credit-related relationship of SME from massive interactions helps comprehensively model the SMEs thus improve the performance of financial risk analysis. In this paper, tackling the data deficiency problem of financial risk analysis for SMEs, we propose an innovative financial risk analysis framework with graph-based supply chain mining. Specifically, to capture the credit-related topological structure and temporal variation of SMEs, we design and employ a novel spatial-temporal aware graph neural network, to mine supply chain relationship on a SME graph, and then analysis the financial risk based on the mined supply chain graph. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposal for financial risk analysis for SMEs. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

Design/methodology/approach: Data mining-based social network analysis was used to investigate the pattern of discussions regarding apparel supply chain transparency on Twitter and Instagram. Findings: Both Instagram and Twitter networks exhibited high interest in environmental, working condition and community support in apparel supply chain as explained by the moral responsibility framework of corporate sustainability despite the intended theme of the campaign to promote transparency in terms of working conditions specifically. However, some inconsistencies were found regarding the importance of these communities in the network, suggesting that while survey methods hold significance in measuring user intension, the reaction-based user-generated data on social media can be useful to measure users' true behavior. Also, while Twitter network was dominated by knowledge-based messages, the Instagram network had emotion-driven messages. Originality/value: By conducting this study, the authors will not only contribute to the existing literature of social media usage in the apparel industry but will also provide a foundation for the use of social network analysis to analyze user-generated data on social media, as this method is fairly new in the textile and apparel industry-related research.

The data mining approach with naïve bayes was used to determine the clusters of areas with high to low interdependency in villages and sub-districts. In addition, the House of Risk (HOR) was used to identify the cause of risks and provided the most effective and efficient alternative strategy to mitigate the uncertainty of the fisheries' supply chain sector.

The result show that the village location, resources, and fishermen's ability to sell and buy their gear were the main determinant factors of interdependency. Furthermore, there were, at least, three clusters of interdependencies with the integration of a web-based system to help spread information to fishermen and aquaculture farmers.

At the same time, the cost and time impact on international supply chains through the port must be kept to a strict minimum, in order to safeguard the competitive position of ports. This paper studies and identifies well-suited state-of-the-art/new technological solutions that should make it possible to screen the maximum possible number of containers (primarily in relation to imports) the most time-effectively. A two-dimensional methodology was applied within the project. First, several interviews were held with associations of shipping companies, forwarders, shippers, terminal operators and customs authorities, in order to combine knowledge gained from the technological assessment with experience from the professional field. Results from the interviews were used to map the current scanning process, as well as the potential for changes to that process. Second, the following tools, solutions and techniques were used as part of the feasibility study and a supply chain impact analysis study: X-ray technology and electromechanical techniques, both supported and not by AI. The results obtained indicate that increasing the scanning rate will increase the cost of scanning for terminals. These costs will be significantly higher than they currently are, particularly for large container terminals. Furthermore, congestion at the terminal and delays in the operational process are essential issues that must be addressed. In the results, distinctions can be made amongst the various types of terminals and scenarios. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."",""Artificial intelligence"; Chain costs; Container supply chain; Economic impact; Electromechanical; Scanning; Screening;" X-ray"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most of them are caused by lengthy and complex supply chains involving multiple entities, processes, and interactions. Studies suggest that technologies like robotics, 3D printing, and artificial intelligence have the potential to reduce the complexity of traditional supply chains. In the context of 3D concrete printing, researchers have focused on the robotic systems and suitable construction materials. However, limited attention was focused on the impact on the construction supply chain (CSC). Although studies in healthcare and aviation investigated the implications of new technologies in their supply chains, the outcome cannot be directly applied to the CSC. In addition, studies that assessed the impact of new technologies on the CSC are limited and mostly qualitative. This study addresses this gap by developing a methodology to simulate the implications of 3D printing on the CSC. The methodology adopted contains four elements: 1) Develop supply chain networks, b) Identify input parameters c) Simulate the supply chain networks, and d) Analyze and discuss results. Results from this preliminary study indicate 15.8% and 52.6% lesser entities in CSC-2 and CSC-3, respectively, when compared to CSC-1"; a 0.2% and 28.2% decrease in overall effort in CSC-2 and CSC-3. respectively, when compared to CSC-1;" and an overall cumulative performance increase of 18.5% and 51.6% in CSC-2 and CSC-3, respectively, when compared to CSC-1.

It is necessary to study potential consumers, identify their requirements and develop a competent marketing strategy for building mutually beneficial relations of the organization with customers. The development of a mechanism for assessing consumer loyalty to the healthcare facility services, its automation with the help of customer relationship management tools should be methodologically justified. Purpose. The research is aimed at developing a methodological approach to healthcare customer loyalty assessment, including identification of target and profitable segments, regulation of business processes, analysis of the customer database and business environment of an organization to increase the effectiveness of its marketing activities. Systemic research of customer relationships includes the following methods and tools: Data Mining methods with instrumental support of Statistica software, including factor analysis and formation of databases of endogenous and exogenous variables"; specification of a mathematical model; correlation analysis; variable multiple linear regression analysis based on the generalized least squares method; model verification using R2-statistics and Fisher (F-test) and Student (t-test) criteria; ABC-and XYZ analysis of revealing customer consumption profiles; the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on expert assessments of the multicriteria problem solution while evaluating the support tools for managing consumer loyalty with a hierarchical structure. The practical and theoretical significance of the results. A methodological approach has been developed to identify healthcare facility (HCF) customer preferences, implemented using a variable multiple linear regression model, including both quantitative (age, number of bed days, etc.) and qualitative (social status, gender, marital status, parental status, education, medical service type) exogenous variables. Consumption profiles of HCF services have been constructed on the basis of their clustering and classification using ABC-and XYZ analyzes. An algorithm for evaluating the support tools of the consumer loyalty analysis has been proposed. The analysis of consumer demand for the organization's services enables to develop an algorithm for assessing consumer loyalty management information systems, to form a system of indicators characterizing potential customers and their preferences in the medical services market;" the most rational and customer-oriented services that reflect the customer's consumption profile. The results can be used as practical tools for improving the economic efficiency of the organization depending on the cluster dynamics of consumption and changes in personal customer characteristics and CRM-based marketing performance support tools. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK."",""CRM-system"; Customer relationship; Data mining; Loyalty; Modelling; Supply chain strategy;" The analytic hierarchy process"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this context, supplier selection in a supply chain of oil companies has a direct effect on immunization and optimization of the production cycle, refining and distribution of petroleum, gas and petroleum products in oil producer and exporter countries. Therefore, creating and owning a purposeful and intelligent process for evaluation and analysis of suppliers is one of the inevitable needs and concerns of these countries. Many of the methods which are currently widely applied in the management of oil companies utilize traditional supplier selection methods which are unfortunately limited to individual and subjective evaluation in weighing decision maker’s criteria, incorrect assessment rules, and inefficient decision-making methods. In this paper, with an in-depth look at the supplier selection in supply chain management of oil companies project, a novel model has been proposed based on an object-oriented framework. This model which finally leads to optimal selection and ranking of suppliers, reducing the time and cost in the selection process and also reduced human errors by using data mining techniques and neural networks in the reasoning method cycle based on the case. The proposed model was implemented on data bank information of the Oil Company. Finally, the results of the proposed model are compared with several other models.

Initially, the association rules are mined from EMA-based healthcare inventory data. After that, SC cost-impact rules are chosen for every SC member using GSA. The obtained SC cost-impact rules will possibly signify the future state of inventory in any SC member.

In order to support this evaluation process, several studies have proposed the application of artificial intelligence techniques combined with the performance metrics suggested by the SCOR® model (Supply Chain Operations Reference). However these propositions present some limitations. While the systems based on Mamdani fuzzy inference do not allow adaptation to the environment of use based on historical performance data, the systems based on artificial neural networks are not adequate to deal with imprecise data and qualitative metrics. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper presents a new approach to support SC performance evaluation based on the combination between the SCOR® metrics with an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS). In total, 56 candidate topologies were implemented and assessed using MATLAB. The random subsampling cross-validation method was applied to select the most appropriate topological parameters for each ANFIS model. The mean square error between the target values and the values estimated by each ANFIS model demonstrate its greater accuracy of prediction. In addition, results of the hypothesis tests based on paired samples indicate that the proposed ANFIS models are adequate to support SC performance evaluation. The proposed system can help managers to develop improvement actions plans based on the outcomes of the evaluation process. When compared to previous approaches, it presents advantages such as greater accuracy of prediction, learning ability based on historical data, suitability to support decision making under uncertainty, better interpretability of results, among others. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"",""ANFIS"; Neuro-fuzzy systems; SCOR® model; Supply chain management;" Supply chain performance evaluation"",""Decision making"; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Mean square error; Supply chain management; Topology; Adaptive network based fuzzy inference system; ANFIS; Artificial intelligence techniques; Decision making under uncertainty; Historical performance data; Neurofuzzy system; Supply chain operations references; Supply chain performance;" Fuzzy inference""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The complexity to obtain an optimal solution using traditional uncertainty management methods dramatically increases with the number of uncertain factors considered. Such a complexity produces that, if tractable, the problem is solved after a large computational effort. Therefore, in this work a data-driven decision-making framework is proposed to address this issue. Such a framework exploits machine learning techniques to efficiently approximate the optimal management decisions considering a set of uncertain parameters that continuously influence the process behavior as an input. A design of computer experiments technique is used in order to combine these parameters and produce a matrix of representative information. These data are used to optimize the deterministic multi-objective bio-based energy network problem through conventional optimization methods, leading to a detailed (but elementary) map of the optimal management decisions based on the uncertain parameters. Afterwards, the detailed data-driven relations are described/identified using an Ordinary Kriging meta-model. The result exhibits a very high accuracy of the parametric meta-models for predicting the optimal decision variables in comparison with the traditional stochastic approach. Besides, and more importantly, a dramatic reduction of the computational effort required to obtain these optimal values in response to the change of the uncertain parameters is achieved. Thus the use of the proposed data-driven decision tool promotes a time-effective optimal decision making, which represents a step forward to use data-driven strategy in large-scale/complex industrial problems. © 2018 The Authors"",""Data-driven decision-support"; Kriging metamodeling; Multiparametric programming; Optimization under uncertainty;" Supply chain management"",""Complex networks"; Decision support systems; Energy resources; Information management; Interpolation; Learning systems; Optimal systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Supply chain management; Uncertainty analysis; Conventional optimization; Data driven decision; Design of computer experiments; Machine learning techniques; Metamodeling; Multi-parametric programming; Optimization under uncertainty; Parametric uncertainties;" Decision making""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Robust Optimization works by evaluating the moments of objective and constraint functions by converting the optimization problem under uncertainty into an equivalent deterministic formulation, the accuracy of which depends on the way the moments is calculated with limited amount of data. Conventional techniques such as box/budget uncertainties work by sampling in a conservative approach, often leading to inaccuracies. In this paper, machine learning and data analytics are amalgamated with robust optimization in search of efficient solutions. A novel ANN fuzzy clustering mechanism is implemented to cluster the uncertain space such that the exact regions of uncertainty are optimally identified. Subsequently, local density based boundary point detection and Delaunay triangulation based boundary construction enable intelligent Sobol based sampling leading to the evaluation of close approximations to the true moments.

We investigate this question by advancing a methodology that integrates laboratory test performance data, field tests of RFID tags fixed to apparel items and scanned under normal operating conditions, and the application of five directed data mining models to the integrated data set of laboratory and field test results. Our analyses of 45,416 observations show that two directed data mining models may identify—with near-100% accuracy—laboratory test criteria that discriminate tags having 99% or greater read-rates in the field.

Due to the compromise between cost and lead-time, it is a non-trivial issue to search for multi-objective Pareto optimal solutions (POS) in SCN. Furthermore, with the wide application of the internet, an increasing number of SCN applications have been based on the internet. As a result, the complexity of SCN increases exponentially with the number of suppliers increasing. It is really a big challenge to find the global multi-objective POS within a limited time in SCN management.

The blockchain has the characteristics of supporting distributed networking, information synchronization among nodes, digital encryption, traceable information and block content that cannot be tampered, which is suitable for use in supply chain, and can provide solution for it. In this paper, a design scheme of integrated platform for information service provided by participants in supply chain and based on Ethereum blockchain is proposed. By using Ethereum smart contracts, the common business involved in the supply chain is realized using blockchain technology, and the key information of supply chain production and circulation is stored on the blockchain to ensure the information cannot be tampered. At the same time, a reputation evaluating method based on smart contracts is used to evaluate the reputation of enterprises in supply chain, which can provide reference for supplier selection among enterprises. © 2019 IEEE."",""Blockchain"; Information platform; Smart contract;" Supply chain management"",""Artificial intelligence"; Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Ethereum; Information management; Information services; Manufacture; Ubiquitous computing; Bullwhip effects; Digital encryption; Distributed networking; Evaluating method; Information platform; Integrated platform; Manufacturing industries; Supplier selection;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

IoT-enabled supply chain provides a natural combination to achieve supply chain visibility (SCV) which refers to ability of supply chain partners to collect and analyse distributed supply chain data for the planning and decision support. This data is normally collected and analysed in real-time by a specialized software known as Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines. However, current CEP engines have two well-known limitations. Firstly, current CEP engines are job specific and fail to combine multiple related sensor data streams coming from distributed sources, thereby, supply chain partners are exposed to manage the underlying information heterogeneity. Secondly, these CEP systems do not provide decision support to the supply chain planners when the information about the potential disruptive event is incomplete and/or uncertain. In this paper, a PERCEPTUS framework is proposed to address the above mentioned issues. It, firstly, utilizes semantic annotation process to integrate and annotate events coming from heterogeneous data streams. Secondly, it performs complex event processing to process and correctly interpret annotated complex events. Thirdly, it provides complex event reasoning (by combining logical and probabilistic reasoning) to predict disruption events (such as process failure) under incomplete and/or uncertain information. Finally, the proposed framework is validated using the dataset of a semi-conductor manufacturing process to demonstrate its superiority in terms of accuracy in predicting disruptive events as compared to the baseline approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."",""Complex event processing"; IoT; Predictive reasoning;" Supply chain"",""Data mining"; Decision support systems; Engines; Semantics; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Complex event processing; Complex event processing (CEP); Information heterogeneity; Internet of Things (IOT); Predictive reasoning; Probabilistic reasoning; Supply chain visibility; Uncertain informations;" Internet of things""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, it is still a challenge for companies to design and maintain a decision-making process supporting strategic supply chain decisions that integrates risk management and unify business vision across departments.

It led to a decision-making process including the use of a computerized information system composed of a software for computations and a business intelligence software to easily make decisions.

E-commerce channel (e-channel) has become an important retail channel. The multi-period closed-loop supply chain network of electronic channels (E-CLSCN) is studied. Moreover, this study considers the influence of consumers' preference for products and artificial intelligence push (AI-push) on network balance under the conditions of dynamic and static. The network consists of manufacturers, remanufacturers, and demandmarkets. Remanufacturers are responsible for collecting andremanufacturing. Themulti-period E-CLSCN model is established through variational inequalities. The study finds that whether dynamic or static, consumers' preference for new products (NP) has positively correlated with the profits of manufacturers and the whole E-CLSCN. Consumers' preference for remanufacturer products (RP) has only positively correlated with the profits of remanufactures. In the aspect of AI-push, the manufacturers' AI-push has positively correlated with the profits of the entire players of E-CLSCN, while the remanufacturers'AI-push has only positively correlatedwith the profits of the remanufacturers. Also, considering the multi-period, the sensitivity of the demand markets for the investment of manufacturers' and remanufacturers' AI-push gradually reduces, and the marginal benefit of AI-push gradually decreases. Finally, this paper addresses interesting managerial insights from the perspective of government and enterprises. Under the dual objectives of environmental protection and economic interests of enterprises, this study provides a reference for governments and enterprises to develop relevant dynamic policies. Namely, the government formulates dynamic environmental protection measures, and enterprises formulate dynamic strategic plans and implement government policies.

For a sustainable construction process, economically, environmentally, and socially friendly practices are essential, and reverse logistics is one solution that can provide such an approach. In reverse logistics, obsolete products are reused in a new production, while reducing negative effects to the environment. In this study, we assess the current state of research on reverse logistics practices in the construction industry. The study presents a comparative data mining analysis, followed by a content analysis. The results show that the construction industry literature ignores the impact of reverse logistics practices on upstream construction activities. We argue that industry practitioners must take reverse logistics decisions in the early phases of the construction process by considering both upstream and end-of-life construction activities, and we recommend a reverse logistics decision framework for successful reverse logistics implementation. The findings of this research are significant for decision-makers in the industry. We urge that sustainable practices be employed in the industry.

Many factors intervene simultaneously and their hard-to-interpret interactions throughout the supply chain greatly complicate decision-making. The complexity clearly manifests itself in the field of inventory management, in which determining the optimal replenishment rule often becomes an intractable problem. This paper applies machine learning to help managers understand these complex scenarios and better manage the inventory flow. Building on a dynamic framework, we employ an inductive learning algorithm for setting the most appropriate replenishment policy over time by reacting to the environmental changes. This approach proves to be effective in a three-echelon supply chain where the scenario is defined by seven variables (cost structure, demand variability, three lead times, and two partners’ inventory policy). Considering four alternatives, the algorithm determines the best replenishment rule around 88% of the time. This leads to a noticeable reduction of operating costs against static alternatives. Interestingly, we observe that the nodes are much more sensitive to inventory decisions in the lower echelons than in the upper echelons of the supply chain. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."",""Bullwhip Effect"; inductive learning; inventory management; machine learning; replenishment policy;" supply chain management"",""Artificial intelligence"; Decision making; Inventory control; Learning systems; Operating costs; Supply chain management; Bullwhip effects; Demand variability; Environmental change; Environmental conditions; Inductive learning; Inventory decisions; Inventory management; Replenishment policy;" Learning algorithms""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The aim of this paper is to use Bayesian Belief Networks to detect cyberattacks on CSC in the CPS domain. We model cyberattacks using DAG method to determine the attack propagation. Further, we use a smart grid case study to demonstrate the applicability of attack and the cascading effects. The results show that BBN could be adapted to determine uncertainties in the event of cyberattacks in the CSC domain. © 2019 IEEE."",""Bayesian Belief Network"; Cyber Attacks; Cyber Physical System; Cyber Supply Chain Threats;" Cybercrime"",""Bayesian networks"; Cyber Physical System; Decision theory; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Knowledge representation; Network security; Supply chains; Cascading effects; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; Cyber-crimes; Cyberattack detection; Cybercrime; Probabilistic inference; Smart grid;" Computer crime""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Contributions of this study include the development of these domains along with several important themes. The insights uncovered by our analysis primarily focus on LCSC modelling, low carbon energy, and carbon emission measurements. Numerous sustainability management practices are associated with low carbon energy use and actions to avoid increasing the rate of climate change.

Thus, forecasting SMEs’ credit risk in SCF has become one of the most critical issues in financing decision-making. Nevertheless, traditional credit risk forecasting models cannot meet the needs of such forecasting. Many researchers argue that machine learning (ML) approaches are good tools. Here we propose an enhanced hybrid ensemble ML approach called RS-MultiBoosting by incorporating two classic ensemble ML approaches, random subspace (RS) and MultiBoosting, to improve the accuracy of forecasting SMEs’ credit risk. The experimental samples, originating from data on forty-six quoted SMEs and seven quoted core enterprises (CEs) in the Chinese securities market between 31 March 2014 and 31 December 2015, are collected to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the RS-MultiBoosting approach. The forecasting result shows that RS-MultiBoosting has good performance in dealing with a small sample size. From the SCF perspective, the results suggest that to enhance SMEs’ financing ability, ‘traditional’ factors, such as the current and quick ratio of SMEs, remain critical. Other SCF-specific factors, for instance, the features of trade goods and the CE's profit margin, play a significant role. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."",""Credit risk forecasting"; Machine learning; Partial dependency plot; RS-MultiBoosting; Small and medium-sized enterprises;" Supply chain finance"",""Commerce"; Decision making; Finance; Learning systems; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Supply chains; Credit risks; Partial dependency plot; RS-MultiBoosting; Small and medium sized enterprise; Supply chain finances;" Forecasting""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The area of “opinion mining”, particularly sentiment analysis, aims to find, extract, and systematically analyze people’s opinions, attitudes and emotions towards certain topics. Performance of a supply chain is closely associated with the level of trust, collaboration, and information sharing among its members. In this paper, using textual “sentiment analysis”, we explore the relationship between elements of social media content generated by supply chain members and performance of supply chain. In particular, we identify specific elements of member generated supply chain related content on social media such as: information sharing, collaboration, trust, and commitment to determine their association with supply chain performance. We find information sharing and collaboration to be positively associated with supply chain performance, and these findings are consistent with previous reports in supply chain literature. In addition, ours is one of the first attempts to use sentiment analysis to analyze social media content in a supply chain context. The findings indicate that supply chain members value the sharing of relevant information and collaborative contents on social media as such efforts improve individual and overall supply chain performance.

On the other hand, evolving information and communication technology offers ample opportunity for more reliable supply chain management practices. Event processing has established itself in many applications in logistics. Although the topic has enjoyed increasing popularity, there is no study taking stock of prior developments and guiding future research. Therefore, a systematic literature review on the topic of event processing in supply chain management from 2005 until the present is undertaken. Extant literature is synthesized and analyzed from technological and supply chain management perspectives to inform scholars and practitioners of existing field developments. Additionally, to guide future scholarly endeavors, a research agenda is derived from promising topics raised in papers and unfulfilled practical requirements. We find that current solutions primarily focus on a limited number of supply chain core processes and a restricted number of supply chain actors. The majority of publications focused on time-temperature sensitive products. Additionally, the domination of road transportation can be observed, while other modes of transport are often ignored in solution implementations. Decision support in terms of object traceability within the supply chain is found in most articles. RFID, typically accompanied by the Electronic Product Code Information Services standard, is the dominant enabling technology.

It provides information flow that makes the supply chain more robust and resilient without undermining its efficiency. Smart systems use artificial intelligence methods for solving problems and facilitating decision-making through rule-based deduction. Accordingly, these systems can present specialists' skills and simulate their thinking process. The primary goal of expert systems is to implement knowledge acquisition process by converting knowledge to wisdom. This process is vital for critical decision-making regarding important issues such as determining necessities of a particular contract. Companies use professional liability insurance of the products and services to ensure the purchasers and prevent potential losses. Although this practice is highly prevalent, there is not any particular procedure for measuring necessities of contracts. The main purpose of this paper is to design a fuzzy expert system for measuring the necessities of professional contracts regarding insurance coverage and improve the supply chain management using IT. This system can measure and report these obligations, considering specifications of each project. Taking into perspective variety of professional services/products, we consider software as a type of professional contracts, extract its important indices and give it to the system as the input. After the necessary stages, the system produces a proper response and presents the generated response to the user. The software of this expert system is web based, and there are four operating layers in its architecture. We implemented this program in MS Visual Studio Framework with C#.NET programming language. Moreover, we implemented MS SQL-Server Database Management. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd"",""fuzzy expert system"; inference engine; knowledge rule base; professional liability insurance;" suppliers"",""Decision making"; Fuzzy inference; Inference engines; Insurance; Problem solving; Professional aspects; Supply chain management; Visual languages; Artificial intelligence methods; Business environments; Fuzzy expert systems; Knowledge rules; Professional liability insurance; Professional services; suppliers; Technology supply chains;" Expert systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The system allows decision makers to evaluate topologies of their supply chain networks in a variety of disruption scenarios, thereby proactively managing the supply chain network to understand vulnerabilities of the network before a disruption occurs.

Traditionally, a contract is a documented agreement that is executed according to a predefined set of rules. Therefore, negotiation, multiple drafting phases, and extensive administrative work are a must. The development of advanced technologies such as IoT and blockchain can potentially make the process effective and efficient through a smart contract, a digital contract that self-executes when predetermined conditions are met. The promises of the advanced technologies can be optimized by utilizing them intelligently.

A high variance between the forecasted demand and the actual demand results in costs that could have been avoided. To eliminate that waste, we developed a model that utilizes artificial neural network to accurately forecast the demand. The model performs forecasting analysis based on multilayer feed-forward neural network with backpropagation. The use of machine learning can assist with the rapid changes in customer demand.

This modeling approach provides the flexibility of having a more simplistic and standardized methodology for its user while the customer receives a customized solution. This provides a user the ability to derive highly accurate material requirement predictions while removing the dependency on the item manager from having personal knowledge and experience in the product being supported. Adaptive statistical modeling techniques account for factors such as the part type, sample data sets, and the varying stages of a given product's life cycle by correlating predicted reliability with realized demand of material. Additionally, artificial intelligence techniques identify trends that would otherwise be unrealized to the item manager. These techniques enable the item manager to have an accounting for otherwise unknown unique product line factors which further increases fidelity of predictions. Adaptive Predictive Modeling provides increased information and accuracy to the process while providing a more streamlined supply chain solution and its various positive impacts across the program. Adaptive Predictive Modeling aligns like product support variables into adjustable parameters and provides a common user interface that accommodates diverse product lines. Accounting for both consumable and repairable material, from piece parts to complex assemblies, this modeling enables fundamental supply chain logistics philosophy to be applied relative to the customer, industry, and process driven data sets. As an input to the Supply Chain, this modeling utilizes predicted reliability Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) data, considered for products in the infancy of their life cycle, while simultaneously considering the products against experienced demand data allowing for identification of an ideal transition point between modeling techniques as a given product's life cycle stage progresses. Throughout the sustainment life cycle, the item manager is enabled to further scrutinize available information, increasingly detailed granularity, through greater observational functionality within the data set, pinpointing potential supply chain improvements.

One main research issues is how to improve the interpretability, while preventing any deterioration of accuracy of the model. For this issues the model-agnostic explanation method is a kind of solution. In the paper we propose a modified LIME algorithm based on locally fitted by decision tree regression called tree-LIME which is a model-agnostic method. Further, we clarify the fidelity measure definition in regression explanation problem by using mean absolute error (MAE). The experiments on real service supply chain forecasting application show that (1) our proposed approach can improve the fidelity of the explainer which lead to a more accurate explanations for individual instances and (2) our approach gives a more intuitive and visualized tree expression for explanation.

With an increasing flux of tourists, hotel industry is bringing artificial intelligence and robotic awareness in their employees to ensure better performance from all dimensions. Such performance levels are also linked with supply chain agility up to some extent. This paper has aimed to analyze the impact of artificial intelligence and robotic awareness on environmental, operational and economic performance of hotel sector of Thailand. Moreover, mediating role of supply chain agility has also been checked in relationship between the respective empirical linkages. Data was collected from the managing employees of hotel sector of Thailand through a structured instrument and it was then analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Results have provided the insight that robotic awareness has significant impact of all three dimensions of performance and supply chain agility significantly mediates these relationships in positive direction. This study is novel due to testing supply chain agility as mediator in robotic awareness and performance linkage and also because of taking operational performance as another dimension of performance which was not tested in prior literature.

A key aspect of using RL in the real world is to train the agent before deployment, so as to minimise experimentation in live operation. While this is feasible for online gameplay (where the rules of the game are known) and robotics (where the dynamics are predictable), it is much more difficult for complex systems due to associated complexities, such as uncertainty, adaptability and emergent behaviour.

One of them is to maximize the efficiency and performance of container handling operations. This is the case, for instance, of the ports of Cartagena, Colombia and Savannah, Georgia, USA, which are now servicing Post-Panamax containerships pretty much in the same time interval they serve Panamax containerships. Post-Panamax containerships can carry 12,000+ TEUs (Twenty Equivalent Units) whereas Panamax containerships can carry up to 4,500 TEUs. A related issue is the need of deepening and widening the port's navigating channel and replacing existing Ship-To-Shore (STS) cranes with bigger STS cranes to accommodate Post-Panamax containerships. Other challenge is to electronically connect in real time with global supply chains comprised of multiple container terminals, shipping companies, custom brokers, port authorities, end customers, etc., which requires the digitalization of logistics and business processes. Related issues are secured sharing of data and effective and purposeful use of data analysis. Another important challenge faced by container terminals is to enforce port security.

As field-development strategies continue to evolve, refracturing and infill-well drilling must be carefully combined to optimize shale-project profitability. Moreover, operators must bear in mind the undulating natural-gas demands persisting in an oversupplied shale-gas environment. In this paper, we use data-driven approaches to predict successful refracturing candidates and local gas demand for the second-tier optimization of a shale-gas supply-chain network. A strategic-planning (SP) model is developed for optimizing the net present value (NPV) of a case-study shale-gas network in the Marcellus Play. This SP model uses a mixed-integer-nonlinear-programming (MINLP) formulation developed in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS, Release 27.1.0.2019). This model relies directly on input from reservoir simulation, local-gas-demand forecast, water-availability forecast, and natural-gas and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude-oil price forecasts. Before reservoir simulation, machine learning (ML) is used to predict successful refracturing candidates, using a feed-forward neural network (NN), random-forest (RF) classifier, and a t-distributed stochastic-neighbor-embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique. Using the obtained results, best-practice field-development strategies are implemented in the area of interest (AOI) using reservoir simulation. Local gas demand is forecasted using a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) recurrent NN (RNN) that uses a multivariate data set created from local and global variables affecting shale-gas demand. A water-management structure is also developed for the optimization framework. Using a 300-well data set (with 17 input features), successful refracturing candidates were proposed according to the joint outcome of an optimal 17/23/128/2 feed-forward NN, a t-SNE plot, and a techno-economic review. After ranking F1 scores, the developed NN outperforms the RF and support-vector-machine (SVM) algorithms for frac/refrac-well classification. The developed 32/256/128/120 LSTM model showed at least a 93% (61%) prediction performance using three or five input features. The results illustrate the ability of the developed LSTM model to accurately predict local gas demands during periods of high or low gas demand. After SP optimization over a 10-year planning horizon, the economic results indicate an NPV of USD 481.945 million, using the proposed physics-data-driven-based approach. An NPV of USD 611.22 million is obtained when no ML was used. The results reveal that the application of ML to strategic planning can prevent erroneous feedback of project profitability while allowing early-time decision making that maximizes shale-asset NPV.

For this purpose, historical data can be analyzed to improve demand forecasting by using various methods like machine learning techniques, time series analysis, and deep learning models. In this work, an intelligent demand forecasting system is developed. This improved model is based on the analysis and interpretation of the historical data by using different forecasting methods which include time series analysis techniques, support vector regression algorithm, and deep learning models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to blend the deep learning methodology, support vector regression algorithm, and different time series analysis models by a novel decision integration strategy for demand forecasting approach. The other novelty of this work is the adaptation of boosting ensemble strategy to demand forecasting system by implementing a novel decision integration model. The developed system is applied and tested on real life data obtained from SOK Market in Turkey which operates as a fast-growing company with 6700 stores, 1500 products, and 23 distribution centers.

Sensor technologies can collect relevant data in forest-based supply chains, comprising all activities from within forests and the production of the woody raw material to its transformation into marketable forest-based products. Advanced planning systems can help to support decisions of the various entities in the supply chain, e.g., forest owners, harvest companies, haulage companies, and forest product processing industry. Such tools can help to deal with the complex interdependencies between different entities, often with opposing objectives and actions—which may increase efficiency of forest-based supply chains. This paper analyzes contemporary literature dealing with digital technologies in forest-based supply chains and summarizes the state-of-the-art digital technologies for real-time data collection on forests, product flows, and forest operations, as well as planning systems and other decision support systems in use by supply chain actors. Higher sustainability and efficiency of forest-based supply chains require a seamless information flow to foster integrated planning of the activities over the supply chain—thereby facilitating seamless data exchange between the supply chain entities and foster new forms of collaboration. Therefore, this paper deals with data exchange and multi-entity collaboration aspects in combination with interoperability challenges related with the integration among multiple process data collection tools and advanced planning systems.

The problem is intended to determine a supply chain configuration of manufacturing plants, distributors, and retailers in the distribution network. The problem is formulated as an integer-programming model. The mathematical model incorporates unit transportation costs between entities and two types of fixed costs, including fixed cost for transportation routes and fixed cost for opening facilities. The objective of the model is to minimise the total costs of supply chain operation incurred in allocating the retailers to a distribution centre and the distribution centres to a manufacturing plant. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based heuristic is developed for solving the model. The heuristic is tested on various problem sizes generated. All the problem instances are solved using solver LINGO to evaluate the robustness of the ACO-based algorithm. The ACO-based heuristic emerges as a computationally efficient algorithm.

Forecast accuracy is, therefore, essential to optimise the efficiency of any supply chain. One aspect that is often overlooked is the fact that sales of many products within an organization are assembled as complex hierarchies with different levels of aggregation. Very often forecasts are produced regardless of such structure, though forecasting accuracy may be improved by taking it into account. In this paper, an approach for hierarchical time series forecasting based on State Space modelling is proposed. Previous developments provide solutions to the hierarchical forecasting problem by algebra manipulations based on forecasts produced by independent models for each time series involved in the hierarchy. The solutions produce optimal reconciled forecasts for each individual forecast horizon, but the link along time that is implied by the dynamics of the models is completely ignored. Therefore, the novel approach in this paper improves upon past research at least in two key points. Firstly, the algebra is already encoded in the State Space system and the Kalman Filter algorithm, giving an elegant and clean solution to the problem. Secondly, the State Space approach is optimal both across the hierarchy, as expected, but also along time, something missing in past developments. The approach is assessed by comparing its forecasting performance to the existing methods, through simulations and using real data of a Spanish grocery retailer. © 2018"",""Decision support system"; Forecasting; Hierarchical forecasting; Reconciliation;" State Space"",""Algebra"; Artificial intelligence; Forecasting; Hierarchical systems; State space methods; Supply chains; Time series; Forecasting accuracy; Forecasting performance; Forecasting problems; Kalman filter algorithms; Management of supply chains; Reconciliation; State space approach; Time series forecasting;" Decision support systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The purpose of this paper is to propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based risk monitoring system (IoTRMS) for controlling product quality and occupational safety risks in cold chains. Real-time product monitoring and risk assessment in personal occupational safety can be then effectively established throughout the entire cold chain. Design/methodology/approach: In the design of IoTRMS, there are three major components for risk monitoring in cold chains, namely: wireless sensor network"; cloud database services;" and fuzzy logic approach. The wireless sensor network is deployed to collect ambient environmental conditions automatically, and the collected information is then managed and applied to a product quality degradation model in the cloud database. The fuzzy logic approach is applied in evaluating the cold-associated occupational safety risk of the different cold chain parties considering specific personal health status. To examine the performance of the proposed system, a cold chain service provider is selected for conducting a comparative analysis before and after applying the IoTRMS. Findings: The real-time environmental monitoring ensures that the products handled within the desired conditions, namely temperature, humidity and lighting intensity so that any violation of the handling requirements is visible among all cold chain parties. In addition, for cold warehouses and rooms in different cold chain facilities, the personal occupational safety risk assessment is established by considering the surrounding environment and the operators’ personal health status. The frequency of occupational safety risks occurring, including cold-related accidents and injuries, can be greatly reduced. In addition, worker satisfaction and operational efficiency are improved. Therefore, it provides a solid foundation for assessing and identifying product quality and occupational safety risks in cold chain activities. Originality/value: The cold chain is developed for managing environmentally sensitive products in the right conditions. Most studies found that the risks in cold chain are related to the fluctuation of environmental conditions, resulting in poor product quality and negative influences on consumer health. In addition, there is a lack of occupational safety risk consideration for those who work in cold environments. Therefore, this paper proposes IoTRMS to contribute the area of risk monitoring by means of the IoT application and artificial intelligence techniques. The risk assessment and identification can be effectively established, resulting in secure product quality and appropriate occupational safety management. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""Cold chain"; Fuzzy logic; Internet of things; Risk monitoring;" Wireless sensor network"",""Artificial intelligence"; Computer circuits; Fuzzy logic; Health; Health risks; Internet of things; Monitoring; Quality control; Risk assessment; Risk management; Safety engineering; Supply chains; Wireless sensor networks; Artificial intelligence techniques; Cold chain; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental Monitoring; Environmentally sensitive; Internet of Things (IOT); Operational efficiencies; Risk monitoring;" Occupational risks""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The presented operational model considers important supply chain features thoroughly, such as different echelons, several suppliers, several manufacturers, and several products, during multiple periods. A multi-objective mathematical programming model is then developed to yield the operational decisions with Pareto efficient performance values and solved using a well-known meta-heuristic algorithm, i.e., NSGAII, the parameters of which are tuned using Taguchi method.

Several business process models were proposed to cope with the increasing risk and complexity of the supply chain operations and events, especially when the unexpected events, caused by the time dependent behaviors, occur. Formal verification approach becomes more interesting choice as the preventive checking of the safety and correctness of a real-time system specification from the very beginning of the design phase. In practice, a timed Petri net as a formal model is commonly used to graphically illustrate the time dependent behaviors of a real-time system. However, the simulation of the timed Petri net is tedious and inefficient for verifying the huge and complex realtime system. Alternatively, Event-B formalization approach provides an efficient and better automatic proving tool, whilst the writing Event-B specification from scratch needs the designer with the mathematical logic backgrounds. In this paper, we still encourage the drawing of an ordinary timed Petri net (OTPN) as a formal model of the supply chain events which is easier and more understandable in the first place. Moreover, we expect that several basic supply chain event patterns, as building blocks of ordinary timed Petri net notations, would help ease the construction of the formal model of the complex production processes. We hereafter propose a mean to transform the given ordinary timed Petri net of the supply chain event patterns into a complete Event-B specification which will be automatically proved by an Event-B prover called Rodin. © 2018 IEEE."",""Basic supply chain patterns"; Event-B; Formal Verification;" Timed Petri nets"",""Artificial intelligence"; Formal verification; Interactive computer systems; Petri nets; Real time systems; Safety engineering; Scheduling algorithms; Specifications; Basic supply chain patterns; Business process model; Complex production; Complex real-time systems; Event-B; Supply chain operation; Time dependent behavior; Timed Petri Net;" Supply chains""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Some current researches have shown that applying blockchain can help ensure food safety. However, they tend to study the traceability of food but not its supervision. This paper provides a blockchain-based credit evaluation system to strengthen the effectiveness of supervision and management in the food supply chain. The system gathers credit evaluation text from traders by smart contracts on the blockchain. Then the gathered text is analyzed directly by a deep learning network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Finally traders’ credit results are used as a reference for the supervision and management of regulators. By applying blockchain, traders can be held accountable for their actions in the process of transaction and credit evaluation.

Discrete event simulation allows complex supply chain models to be mapped in a straightforward manner to study supply chain dynamics, test alternative strategies, communicate findings and facilitate understanding of various stakeholders. The presented analyses confirm that discrete event simulation is well-suited for analyzing interconnected wood supply chain transportation issues on an operational and tactical level. Transport is the connective link between interrelated system components of the forest products industry. Therefore, a survey on transport logistics allows to analyze the significance of entire supply chain management considerations to improve the overall performance and not only one part in isolation. Thus far, research focuses mainly on biomass, unimodal truck transport and terminal operations. Common shortcomings identified include rough explanations of simulation models and sparse details provided about the verification and validation processes. Research gaps exist concerning simulations of entire, resilient and multimodal wood supply chains as well as supply and demand risks.

In this paper the concepts of a supply chain and effectiveness were characterized. The supply chain is a structure of entities which are connected with each other by the use of material and financial flows and functional, structural, technological, economic and information dependencies. Entities such as: suppliers, final recipients, entrepreneurs, warehouse facilities, supply centers, logistics operators, carriers, etc. perform material flows from suppliers to recipients. The concept of efficiency, in general terms, refers to economic rationality and means the relationship between the achieved or expected effects and the expenditures incurred. Additionally, indicators of measuring the effectiveness of the supply chain were described. In order to assess the effectiveness of the supply chain the decision model was developed. Optimization is crucial in decision support systems. The development of an appropriate model for mapping the behavior of a real object or system and formulating an optimization task is a necessary activity in effective management. This is even more important if we want to be competitive. Along with the development of decision support systems, as well as the development of systems for data acquisition on the system functioning, which feed optimization models in ever more detailed form, complex decision models are created that take into account many optimization criteria and require a large amount of data. It allows, however, to ensure the sustainable development of the system and simultaneous implementation of its basic tasks. The main aim of this paper is to present the stages and assumptions of the model for assessing the effectiveness of the supply chain.

The total output capacity is determined initially and after the production of common parts is completed as the capacity will be limited by the production of common parts when determining the output quantities of the various final products based on the updated demand forecast. Therefore, this paper considers the supply chain coordination considering retailers' default risk in trade credit.

This work proposes a flexible supply chain network design (SCND) model that uses generalized production/warehousing nodes instead of individual production plants and warehouses while conquers with demand uncertainty using a scenario-based approach. It also deals with inventory management and decisions on strategical and tactical level (facility location, production rate, warehouse capacity, demand allocation between generalized nodes, inventory levels, product flows, suppliers’ product availability and links between all facilities). The proposed Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model allows intra-layer flows between generalized nodes and aims at minimizing total network cost. A case study is formed to test the applicability of the model for a medium sized European company. A comparison was made between a classic supply chain network and generalized network that deals with uncertainty. Results have revealed cost benefits for this model, making it not only applicable, but also cost effective for the company that will apply it.

The research provides a platform for group decision making to facilitate decision process and check the consistency of the outcomes. Methodology The proposed model looks at the decision problem from two points of view considering both technical and customer perspectives. The main customer criteria are confidence in a safe and durable product, emission of pollutants and hazardous materials, social responsibility, etc. The main technical factors are financial stability, quality, delivery condition, services, etc. based on the literature review. The second stage in the adopted methodology is the combination of quality function deployment and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution to effectively analyze the decision problem. In final section we structure a group decision system called GRoUp System (GRUS) which has been developed by Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse (IRIT) in the Toulouse University.

This integrated and efficient decision support system enhances quality and reliability of the decision making. Novelty/Originality The novelty of this paper is reflected by several items. The integration of group multi-criteria decision tools enables decision makers to obtain a comprehensive understanding of customer needs and technical requirements of the logistic process. In addition, this investigation is carried out under a European commission project called Risk and Uncertain Conditions for Agriculture Production Systems (RUC-APS) which models risk reduction and elimination from the agricultural supply chain.

This is a typical logistic network which is affected by irregular demand resulting from contract and non-contract business strategies. Hence, existing forecasting methods that work excellent with smooth and linear demand patterns become less accurate with increasing erratic, lumpy and intermittent demands. Moreover, increasing number of stock keeping units (SKUs) in service supply chains have computational limitations. This is because of the fact that demand keep on fluctuating their demand classes that result in uncertainty and consequently, leads to higher target stock levels (TSL) and lower reorder point (ROP) to ensure higher customer satisfaction. This raises interest in using AI for service supply chains to improve demand forecast accuracy.

However, actual completion time always deviated from the standard completion time due to unavoidable factors and consequently affect delivery due date and ultimately lead to customer dissatisfaction. Besides, it is found that little attention has been given in analysing completion time at production line from previous literatures. Therefore, this paper fill the knowledge gap by predicting completion time based on historical data of production line activities and discovers the most influential factor that contributes to the tardiness or a late job's due date from its completion time. A wellknown company in producing audio speaker is selected as a case company. Based on the review of previous works, it is found that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has superior capability in prediction of future occurrence by capturing the underlying relationship among variables through historical data. Besides, ANN is also capable to provide final weight for each of related variable. Variable with the highest value of final weight indicates the most influential variable and should be concerned more to solve completion time issue which has persisted among entities in supply chain system.

As industry is generally reluctant to provide data due to privacy concerns and trade secret protection, the authors of this paper, designed and conducted a web-based trust behavioral experiment. The data collected was used to evaluate the proposed trust mechanism through an Agent-Based Social Simulation. The results revealed that it is possible to infer trust relationships from behavioral experiments and historical based data, and use these relationships to influence the procurement, ordering and information sharing process.

Supply chain management (SCM) consists of two basic processes: (a) production planning and inventory control process and (b) distribution and logistics process. The SCM objective is to maximize competitiveness and profitability not only for the company but the entire supply chain network, including the ultimate-customer. This is achieved by synchronizing customer requirements with the flow of materials from suppliers, while causing a reduction in inventory investment in the chain, and increasing the customer satisfaction. The selection of appropriate performance evaluation measures for supply chain analysis, given the inherent complexity in SCM, is critical. Traditional SCM performance measures focused on financial measures (e.g. net present value). Such methods are best suited for simple SCM applications. In addition, modeling transportation operations in SCM lacks a concise representation of the transportation cost function. The purpose of this paper is to review current status of SCM and propose a framework that integrates relevant performance measures and decision variables in SCM. The supply chain evaluation system includes resource, output, and flexibility measures. The framework includes a transportation optimization module and a supply chain module for routing decision using private or outsourced fleet. The optimization module incorporates not only transportation cost, but also other relevant performance measures. In addition, the framework includes a decision support system that integrates various measures and the trade-off among them. Finally, risk assessment is implemented to minimize supply chain disruptions and uncertainties.

They developed from classical intra-SCs to inter-SCs and further to flexible and more complex SC-networks. Because of globally distributed SC networks, dynamic environments and increasing customer expectations managers are faced with new challenges. The increasing complexity of SCs results in a new dimension of risks (variable, uncertain, global), that has to be considered and managed. Hence, managers are required to assess these new risks and make decisions in a very complex and dynamic environment. Therefore, methods and tools are needed to support managers in evaluating scenarios and decision making. Modeling and simulation are often used for latter purposes as they are techniques to describe, shape and investigate problems. Especially they are used to improve the problem understanding, test and compare different scenarios and make what-if analyses without influencing the real world. The focus of this paper is on the evaluation of risks along the SC, especially on the quantification of risks for further evaluation using simulation. Special attention has been given to risks related to countries. Appropriate risk indicators have been identified and discussed.

The increasing number of producing wells, in addition to re-fractured wells, impose the need for optimizing field development strategies and shale gas supply chain networks that maximize profitability. Moreover, operators must account for undulating natural gas demands both locally and externally in a persistently low oil price environment. In this paper, we adopt supervised machine learning approaches to forecast local natural gas demand as well as guide well re-frac candidature. Both serve as critical inputs for maximizing the net present value of any shale gas field development project. An optimized water management structure is also incorporated in the proposed framework to account for associated produced-water recycling. Considering a shale gas network in the Marcellus play, supply chain optimization was achieved using a mixed integer non-linear programming formulation. The Strategic Planning model relies on at least 4 major efforts including reservoir simulation, which in turn relies on output from a feed forward Neural Network (NN) algorithm. The trained NN algorithm was deemed suitable for recommending re-frac candidates, necessary decision variables for multiphase reservoir simulation. Finally, NPV optimization relied on a fourlayer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, developed for forecasting local shale gas demand. Both neural network algorithms were scripted using python. 17 non-redundant parameters were mined for 250 wells in the case study. The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding technique was used to visualize related low dimensional manifolds within the highdimensional data set, and a NN algorithm was used to obtain probabilities of misclassification. The wellpads in the case study superstructure are modeled using compositional reservoir simulation. Each reservoir model is tuned by history matching production and pressure data for designated producing wells. Alternative field development strategies (including re-fracturing) are then simulated for a 10-year planning horizon to generate gas and water rate decline profiles. Using the LSTM developed, local gas demand is forecasted using data sets created from multivariate time-dependent local and global variables affecting shale gas demand. The LSTM algorithm is derived by convolving some features from the raw data set, with finedtuned weights, with the objective of minimizing a pre-defined demand error function. The results obtained show that application of this integrated approach can give operators a calculated advantage, preventing erroneous feedback of project profitability but allowing early time decision-making that maximizes shale asset NPV.

The models developed would use the data (data-driven modeling) as early as possible at the modeling phase, which would lead to a better and more realistic representation of the problems being modeled. Design/methodology/approach – An essential feature of the presented approach is its declarativeness. The use of a declarative approach that additionally includes constraint satisfaction problems and provides an opportunity of fast and easy modeling of constrains different in type and character. Implementation of the proposed approach was performed with the use of an original hybrid method in which constraint logic programming (CLP) and mathematical programming (MP) are integrated and transformation of a model is used as a presolving technique. Findings – The proposed constraint-driven approach has proved to be extremely flexible and efficient. The findings obtained during part of experiments dedicated to efficiency were very interesting. The use of the constraint-driven approach has enabled finding a solution depending on the instance data up to 1,000 times faster than using the MP. Research limitations/implications – Due to the limited use of exact methods for NP-hard problems, the future study should be to integrate the CLP with environments other than the MP. It is also possible, e.g., with metaheuristics like genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, etc. Practical implications – There is a possibility of using the approach as a basis to build a decision support system for FSCM, simple integration with databases, enterprise resource planning systems, management information systems, etc. Originality/value – The new constraint-driven approach to FSCM has been proposed. The proposed approach is an extension of the hybrid approach. Also, a new decision-making model of distribution and logistics for the food supply chain is built.

The purpose of this paper is to identify and trade off the critical supply chain measures which are interrelated and in contradiction with each other. Design/methodology/approach - The GLE was developed as an extension of the supply chain performance assessment tool proposed by Banomyong and Supatn (2011). It contained nine measures covering key activities along the supply chain under dimensions of cost, time and reliability. Their interrelations were figured out by causal linkages, whereas their contradictions were traded off as multi-objective optimization. It is solved using fuzzy goal programming along with a weighted max-min operator in order to acquire the Pareto-optimal solution. Findings - The results from the GLE showed there were two critical supply chain measures including supply chain cost per sales and average order cycle time. They contradictorily influenced by a root-cause, namely product lot size. Its Pareto-optimal value was provided to achieve the minimized values of supply chain cost per sales and average order cycle time which were consistent with their relative weights. Research limitations/implications - As generic features, the GLE needs further validation in several industries under various supply chain strategies. The further validation may contribute the GLE to include multiple decision variables, multiple types of product and multiple periods of time. In addition, the GLE may consider a dimensional measure of environmental impact along the supply chain activities. Originality/value - The GLE is a unique decision support system to identify and trade off the critical, interrelated and contradicting supply chain measures. More uniqueness is obtained when the GLE offers an option of inputting a set of relative weights for the interrelated supply chain measures."",""Optimization"; Small-And medium-sized enterprises;" Supply chain management"",""Artificial intelligence"; Computer programming; Costs; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pareto principle; Supply chain management; Design/methodology/approach; Development stages; Fuzzy goal programming; Pareto optimal solutions; Small and medium sized enterprise; Supply chain costs; Supply chain performance; Supply chain strategy;" Decision support systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To better understand such uncertainties requires statistical analysis and data-intensive computing enabled by cyberGIS (aka geographic information science and systems based on advanced cyberinfrastructure and e-science). Therefore, we have developed a cyberGIS approach to optimize biomass supply chains under uncertainties. Our approach (1) designs optimal biomass supply chains from regional to national scale with flexible spatial selection of study areas"; (2) performs uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to quantify how various sources of uncertainty in the biomass supply chain contribute to the variation of optimal results;" and (3) provides users with online geodesign features. This approach has been implemented as a decision support system through integration of data management, mathematical modeling, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and result representation and visualization. An optimization modeling analysis of 7000 scenarios using Monte Carlo methods has been conducted to quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity impact of various input factors on ethanol production costs and optimal biomass supply chain configurations in Illinois, United States. The results from uncertainty analysis showed that the minimal ethanol production costs range from $2.30 to $3.43 gal−1, considering uncertainties from biomass supply, transportation, and processing. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biomass-ethanol conversion rate was the most influential factor to ethanol production costs while the optimal biomass supply chain infrastructure was sensitive to changes in biomass yield, raw biomass transportation cost, and logistics loss rate. Leveraging high performance computing power through cutting-edge cyberGIS software, what-if scenario analysis has been evaluated to make decisions in case of unexpected events occurring in the supply chain operations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"",""Biomass supply chain"; CyberGIS; Geodesign; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Spatial decision support system;" Uncertainty"",""Artificial intelligence"; Biomass; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Data visualization; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ethanol; Factor analysis; Geographic information systems; Information management; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Transportation; Biomass supply chain; CyberGIS; Geodesign; Spatial decision support systems; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; biomass; cost analysis; decision making; demand-side management; design method; GIS; market conditions; numerical model; optimization; price dynamics; processing; sensitivity analysis; software; supply chain management; transportation; uncertainty analysis; visualization; yield; Illinois;" United States""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although several researchers have focused on supply chain disruptions and have discussed the measures that companies should use to design better supply chains, or study the different ways that could help firms to mitigate the consequences of a supply chain disruption, the lack of an appropriate method to predict time to disruptive events is strongly felt. Based on this need, this paper introduces statistical flowgraph models (SFGMs) for survival analysis in supply chains. SFGMs provide an innovative approach to analyze time-to-event data. Time-to-event data analysis focuses on modeling waiting times until events of interest occur. SFGMs are useful for reducing multistate models into an equivalent binary-state model. Analysis from the SFGM gives an entire waiting time distribution as well as the system reliability (survivor) and hazard functions for any total or partial waiting time.

Some of the major areas that rely on precise and accurate address geocoding are supply chain fulfilment, supply chain analytics and logistics. In this paper, we present some of the challenges faced in practice while building an address geocoding engine as a core capability at Flipkart. We discuss the unique challenges of building a geocoding engine for a rapidly developing country like India, such as, fuzzy region boundaries, dynamic topography and lack of convention in spellings of toponyms, to name a few. We motivate the need for building a reliable and precise address geocoding system from a business perspective and argue why some of the commercially available solutions do not suffce for our requirements. SAGEL has evolved through 3 cycles of solution prototypes and pilot experiments. We describe the learnings from each of these phases and how we incorporated them to get to the first production-ready version. We describe how we store and index map data on a SolrCloud cluster of Apache Solr, an open-source search platform, and the core algorithm for geocoding which works post-retrieval in order to determine the best matches among a set of candidate results. We give a brief description of the system architecture and provide accuracy results of our geocoding engine by measuring deviations of geocoded customer addresses across India, from verified latitude, longitude coordinates of those addresses, for a sizeable address set. We also measure and report our system's ability to geocode up to different region levels, like city, locality or building. We compare our results with those of the geocoding service provided by Google against a set of addresses for which we have verified latitude-longitude co-ordinates and show that our geocoding engine is almost as accurate as Google's, while having a higher coverage. © 2016 ACM."",""Geographic Information Retrieval"; Spatial Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery; Spatio-Textual Searching;" Storage and Indexing"",""Developing countries"; Digital storage; Engines; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Maps; Supply chain management; Address description; Business perspective; Geographic information retrieval; Open source searches; Spatial data mining; Spatio-Textual Searching; Supply chain logistics; System architectures;" Data mining""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Since the mathematical model is an NP-hard one, finding the exact solution is time consuming and complex. A hybrid heuristic model combining dynamic programming, ant colony optimization and tabu search has been proposed to solve the problem.

Not only includes manufacturers and suppliers, but also transporters, warehouses, retailers and customers, among others. Due to technological advances, specifically in areas such as communications, computer processing and information storage, it can support the supply chain management more efficiently. In this context, the artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in different SC processes, but there is not specific knowledge about which techniques of IA are being applied (or not) in the SC processes or what SC process are being supported (or not) with AI techniques. Based on the aforementioned, the aim of this study was to establish empirically the contribution of AI in the SC process, in order to establish research activities for the future. To accomplish this, a systematic review was conducted considering the SCOR reference model for SC processes. The main results indicate that genetic algorithms and intelligent agents are the most investigated for SC processes related to planning activities and, to a lesser extent, to processes related to the delivery of products.

In practice, it is needed to formulate and solve real problems through efficient algorithms in a reasonable time. Hence, this paper tries to cover real case problem with a multi-objective model and an integrated forward/reverse logistics network design. Further, the model is customized and implemented for a case study in gold industry where the reverse logistics play crucial role. A new solution approach is applied for the proposed 7-layer network of the case study and the solutions are achieved in order solve the current difficulties of the investigated supply chain. This paper seeks to address how a multi objective logistics model in the gold industry can be created and solved through an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm. A green approach based on the CO2 emission is considered in the network design approach. The developed model includes four echelons in the forward direction and three echelons in the reverse. First, an integer linear programming model is developed to minimize costs and emissions. Then, in order to solve the model, an algorithm based on ant colony optimization is developed. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been compared with the optimum solutions of the LINGO software through various numerical examples based on the random data and real-world instances. The evaluation studies demonstrate that the proposed model is practical and applicable and the developed algorithm is reliable and efficient. The results prove the managerial implications of the model and the solution approach in terms of presenting appropriate modifications to the mangers of the selected supply chain.

While the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology bears merits such as automatic wireless identification without direct eye-sight contact, its security has been one of the main concerns in recent researches such as tag data tampering and cloning. Moreover, privacy leakage of the partners along the supply chains may lead to complete compromise of the whole system, and in consequence all authenticated products may be replaced by the faked ones! Quite different from other conventional databases, datasets in supply chain scenarios are temporally correlated, and every party of the system can only be semi-trusted.

Furthermore, many experience-driven heuristics are increasingly used in everyday business practices. These heuristics are not supported by substantive scientific evidence";" however, they are sometimes very hard to outperform. This can be attributed to the robustness of these simple and practical solutions such as aggregation approaches for example (across time, customers and products).

Nonetheless, implementing an efficient collaborative solution is a wide process where several obstacles must be faced. This work explores the key role of experimentation as a model-driven decision support system for managers in the convoluted decision-making process required to evolve from a reductionist approach (where the overall strategy is the sum of individual strategies) to a holistic approach (where global optimization is sought through collaboration). We simulate a four-echelon supply chain within a large noise scenario, while a fractional factorial design of experiments (DoE) with eleven factors was used to explore cause-effect relationships. By providing evidence in a wide range of conditions of the superiority of the holistic approach, supply chain participants can be certain to move away from their natural reductionist behavior. Thereupon, practitioners focus on implementing the solution. The theory of constraints (TOC) defines an appropriate framework, where the Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) method integrates supply chain processes and synchronizes decisions. In addition, this work provides evidence of the need for aligning incentives in order to eliminate the risk to deviate. Modeling and simulation, especially agent-based techniques, allows practitioners to develop awareness of complex organizational problems. Hence, these prototypes can be interpreted as forceful laboratories for decision making and business transformation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, a low inventory level will cause the company to have little buffer to face the unforeseeable demand surge, which strengthens the close relationship between the stage of production and distribution. This paper probes an integrated production and distribution scheduling problem in which jobs are first produced by a set of unrelated parallel machines and then directly distributed to the corresponding customers by vehicles with limited capacity, with no inventory kept at the production stage. The objective is to find a joint production and distribution schedule such that the total cost, considering both customer service level and total distribution cost, is minimized. This paper integrated the earliest available machine first (EAMF) and variable neighborhood search (VNS) to solve the two-stage scheduling problem and used EAMF, which considers the load of the unrelated parallel machine to generate a set of production schedules to be systematically optimized by VNS, along with optimized routing, and applied a shaking mechanism of VNS to escape from the local optimal solution. The results of the computational experiments showed that the proposed method is better than ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic methods in the computation time and solution quality.

The complex workflows, dependency between partners and their location pose a big challenge in construction project management. How to schedule activities to meet the construction project requirements under resource constraints is an important issue. To create a feasible schedule for a construction project, companies in a typical construction supply chain need to negotiate with each other. Development of an effective software system to support negotiation and collaboration between the partners in a construction supply chain is urgent. Execution of workflows in a construction project usually depends on location. Although workflow management problems have been extensively studied for decades, location information of workflows is rarely taken into account in existing literature. In this paper, we will study the development of a location-aware workflow scheduling system for construction supply chains. We will propose a flexible scheduling system to optimize the construction project schedule based on collaboration of entities/partners in a construction supply chain. We propose a methodology that includes modeling of location-aware workflows in construction projects based on formal workflow models and develop a technique to transform workflow models to formulate and solve a project scheduling problem.

In this paper, we start with a brief sketch of how modern logistics and supply chains emerged as a result of diversification and specialization of industrial production, globally scattered availability of resources and more demanding consumer markets. Jointly with advances in freight transport and communication technologies, these developments have led to the global economy we face today. The strong growth of trade and consumption however also revealed some essential weaknesses of the system that renders current practices in the long run unsustainable—in social, environmental and economic terms (people, planet, profit). Future supply chains should no longer deplete scarce natural resources or contribute to climate change, should avoid environmental pollution and withstand safety and security threats, while at the same time remaining competitive and satisfying high labor quality standards. This requires not only the application of advanced technologies to mitigate or even neutralize these negative effects, but also the development of smart business models, new job qualification standards and corresponding (lifelong) training and education programs at all levels, including artificial intelligence based learning. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."",""Artificial intelligence"; Circular economy; Global supply chains; Logistics; Logistics education; Logistics trends; Physical internet;" Sustainability"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

More specifically, the Inspection Test Plan (ITP) budgets are being increasingly subjected to cost reductions pressure that is often based on inconsistent methodologies across the oil and gas industry and sometimes within the same company. DNV GL developed a consistent risk based methodology (Next generation inspection, NGI) that combines: criticality of equipment and/or material, • criticality of suppliers, equipment and supplier historical data";" and enables the reduction of the overall ITP budget in a consistent and controlled manner while using data smart concepts. In the procurement phase, NGI introduces a tool to measure a manufacturer's ability to control the process and product quality by using a rating assessment methodology and quantitatively documenting the operation's """"capability level"""" measured against the project's or asset's specific criteria. This would recognize and prevent potential complications and improve manufacturing processes during production or in precontract phase in connection with new projects. Assessed vendor's ratings along with equipment/material design criticality are then used to develop a matrix with """"inspection criticality"""" output. Inspection interventions in the ITP can then be marked based on the inspection criticality which streamlines the process into an optimized plan culminating in lesser inspections with more reliable and higher added value on the output. The data smart platform provides information that is known about an item or equipment historically and conversely identifies where there is a lack of information about a supplier capability or equipment. It is recognized in the industry that CAPEX related inspection costs could be further reduced by inspection of equipment based on their criticality. Despite the availability of equipment inspection data, learning from past events and historical data is not being consistently used in determining this criticality due to the lack of an overall data mining and analysis capability. Furthermore, the anomalies in the supply of products by unqualified vendors/suppliers to oil and gas projects are causing significant shortfalls in the quality of the goods delivered. This has led to a major impact on delivery schedules and spiraling costs resulting in the loss of revenue on these projects. Again vendor/ manufacturer historical data exists but are randomly used. This methodology involves a combination of traditional inspection methods and the development of a practical risk-based strategy capable of minimizing the inspection costs while maintaining and improving the effectiveness of the work carried out on a data smart platform.

We have developed a way of assessing the robustness of a logistics plan and associated supply chain by considering the occurrence of disruptive negative events. These events may occur in isolation or simultaneously. Each event is associated with a plan variable and the impact of a negative event can then be assessed by measuring whether the modification of its associated variable causes any stockouts in the plan during simulation. By modifying any two variables simultaneously, we can identify the minimum values of those two variables, which in combination cause a stockout. These minimum values are called breakpoints, and a set of breakpoints is referred to as a breakpoint front. We have investigated various approaches of calculating or estimating breakpoint fronts, including brute force search, the Monte Carlo method, 2D binary search and the multi-objective optimization methods, SPEA2 and NSGA-II. Our experiments showed that 2D binary search performed best overall, due to its low computation time and accuracy in calculating a range of breakpoint fronts. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Apache Spark is termed to be 100 times faster than Hadoop and this allows an organization to process the same big data in a shorter span of time thus, addressing the increasing demand effectively. In this research paper we put forward the details about the Apache Spark framework while comparing it with the existing Hadoop framework alongside, how using Apache Spark framework in Supply chain management for data analytics would benefit the organization and businesses. © 2016 The Authors."",""analytics"; Data; Hadoop; Spark;" Supply chain management"",""Big data"; Data mining; Electric sparks; Virtual reality; analytics; Data; Data analytics; Hadoop; Hadoop frameworks; Research papers;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Every stage has a set of options that can perform the stage and every option has an associated cost and time. Hence, the problem is to select an option per stage that minimises the safety stock and lead time at the same time. We proposed solving the problem using two swarm intelligent meta-heuristics, Ant Colony and Intelligent Water Drop, because of their results in solving NP-hard problems such as the safety stock problem. In our proposed algorithm, swarms are created and each one selects an option per stage with its safety stock and lead time. After that, the Pareto Optimality Criterion is applied to all the configurations to compute a Pareto front. A real-life logistic network of the automotive industry is solved using our proposed algorithm.

Biofuels production from various lignocellulosic biomass types, such as wood, forest residues, and agriculture residues, have the potential to replace a portion of the total fossil fuel consumption. This study focused on locating biofuel facilities and designing the biofuel supply chain to minimise the overall cost. For this purpose, an integrated methodology was proposed by combining the Geographic Information System technology with simulation and optimisation modelling methods. The GIS-based method was used as a precursor for selecting biofuel facility locations by employing a series of decision factors. The identified candidate sites for biofuel production served as inputs for simulation and optimisation modelling. The simulation/optimisation model and identified locations provided an integrated decision support system for decision makers to determine the optimal cost, energy consumption, and emissions for candidate locations.

Therefore, in the industrial world, firms cannot risk waiting for the actual demand to occur so they can react and determine the quantities to purchase, produce or deliver. Demand forecasts are important and necessary to any member of the supply chain as they gave them the advantage of planning and anticipating for future needs. However, demand forecasting is one of those crucial decisions where an error can cost too much. This is why we choose to implement the artificial neural network as a forecasting technique. Obviously the closest actor to the market i.e the retailer has the best view of demand levels than the supplier, so sharing demand information with the other actors has an impact on the performance of the whole supply chain but it is not necessarily the case since the retailer can choose to withhold this information. This is why we focus in this investigation on the demand’s prediction when information is not shared using the artificial intelligence of neural networks. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

However, coordinative models give benefit to the whole supply chain. Research has been carried out the application of these two types of models in the supplier selection problems. In this study, we have considered coopetition in a supply chain, with the objective of selecting a supplier from a pool of suppliers and allocating optimal order quantities for the acquisition of a firm’s total requirements for a particular product. The competition in a one buyer- multiple suppliers system in the supplier selection process has been considered by applying mixed-integer nonlinear programming in first phase. On the other hand, the total cost to the whole supply chain is minimized rather than only for the buyer. Genetic Algorithm, Artificial Bee Colony, and Chaotic Bee Colony are used separately in the second phase as optimization techniques. We find that the All Units discount scheme is more preferable than the Incremental Units discount scheme. However, in the case for different values of the discount percentage and levels, or when supplier provides different type of scheme, other policies need to be explored. Finally, the proposed model is illustrated by a numerical example from the literature. A better result is found for the buyer’s cost by applying the proposed two-phase method, while the result is comparable result for the supply chain cost. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."",""Artificial intelligence"; Chaotic Bee Colony; Coopetition; Expert system;" Supply chain management"",""Artificial intelligence"; Costs; Expert systems; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Supply chain management; Artificial bee colonies; Chaotic Bee Colony; Co-opetition; Mixed-integer nonlinear programming; Multi echelon supply chains; Optimal order quantity; Optimization techniques; Supplier selection process;" Sales""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These challenges exist for conventional fruit trading, but are particularly important for etailing because it removes the customer's traditional role in selecting their own fruit, and thus the blame for any disappointment will be wholly on the e-tailer. As e-tailers put considerable value on the trustworthiness of their brand, this will generate a new demand for technology that will require the fruit supply chain to improve the predictability and safety of its products. In the near future we can expect to see the demands of business-to-consumer e-commerce driving a transformation in the global fruit trade into an information-intensive industry, leading to the implementation of many new sensor systems. Technology companies entering the fruit industry and creating vertically integrated operations from orchard to retail will bring an enthusiasm for new technology, the resources to develop it and the means to extract value from it.

Complex decision making processes on strategic, tactical, and operational levels require substantial timely support in order to contribute to organizations' agility. Consequently, there is a need for sophisticated dynamic product pricing mechanisms that can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and competitors' strategies. We propose a two-layered machine learning approach to compute tactical pricing decisions in real time. The first layer estimates prevailing economic conditions-economic regimes-identifying and predicting current and future market conditions. In the second layer, we train a neural network for each regime to estimate price distributions in real time using available information. The neural networks compute offer acceptance probabilities from a tactical perspective to meet desired sales quotas. We validate our approach in the trading agent competition for supply chain management. When competing against the world's leading agents, the performance of our system significantly improves compared to using only economic regimes to predict prices. Profits increase significantly even though the prices and sales volume do not change significantly. Instead, tactical pricing results in a more efficient sales strategy by reducing both finished goods and components inventory costs. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute."",""Auctions"; Dynamic Pricing; Economic Regimes; Multi-agent systems;" Supply Chain Management"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This paper describes the building and evaluation of a flexible decision support tool that evaluates the impact an ES has on supply chain management (SCM), thereby filling a gap in the SCM assessment portfolio of tools. The main purpose of the Enterprise System Evaluating Tool (ESET), is to measure the support given by ES to SCM and identify process points at which such support fails. Thus ESET empowers organisations with knowledge to improve their supply chain performance by modifying and/or enhancing the ES. A case study based approach was used to evaluate ESET to ascertain its utility by applying it in two Fortune 100 organisations within one industry. In future research, ESET will be applied across many industries, to quantitatively evaluate ESET and refine it further.

About one-third of fresh produce goes to waste because of improper sanitary, temperature and RH handling. Similarly, in the US there are, annually, approximately 76 million incidents of food poisoning, 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths with direct economic cost of over USD $35 billion. A number of technologies have been developed to deal with waste and food safety risks, e.g., data loggers, gas chromatographs, and pathogen detection devices (e.g., 3M Molecular detection System). Unfortunately all such devices are independent of each other, fragmented in their data stream, and prevent decision makers from having a full view of risks associated with the consumption of perishable goods. To overcome such deficiencies, the Xsense® technology was designed as a platform for real time data collection, data communication and information. At its core, the technology is conceived as a tag capable of carrying multiple sensor devices, collecting data on temperature, RH, and various volatile and pathogen specific gases. Data collection is in real time, using novel and advanced active RF-based mesh networking communication technology, and transmitting the collected data along with GPS locations through an innovative Communication Device to a centralized data center (server in a cloud) to enable the construction of data mining for the purpose of information generation through analytics processes. The Xsense® system offers a holistic approach to the mitigation of risks associated with quality, freshness, and food safety in the supply chain. Once the data have been collected and transmitted, the Xsense® technology generates, among other things, Cold Chain Logistic (CCL) scores and Pallets in Risk (PIR) indicators, thereby enabling the transformation of inventory management from First-in-First-Out (FIFO) to First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO)."",""Cold Chain"; Postharvest; Real time monitoring;" Xsense®"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Uncertainty is defined by discrete scenarios on demands where occurrence probability of each scenario is known. The optimization objectives are to minimize transit time and total cost, including opening cost, assumed for opening potential DCs and shipping cost from DCs to the customers, where considering different types of vehicles leads to a more realistic model and causes more conict in these two objectives.

The introduction of the Web has led to increasing emphasis in AI on the development of planning algorithms for real-world applications where planning is distributed and plan generation can happen concurrently with plan execution. An example of one such real-world application is logistics and supply chain. In this paper, we envisage a collaborative planning and execution framework for logistics and supply chain operations. The framework supports human planners for a collaborative plan construction. The planning is interleaved with execution where new information collected during execution is used to refine the plan if required. Additionally, planning is defeasible in nature. During planning either conflicting viewpoints may arise among planners and/or the new information collected during execution may result in conflicts among planned tasks (situations). Deliberation module in the proposed framework provides a platform to human planners where they can start an argumentative dialogue to resolve the conflicts by establishing preferences between conflicting tasks.

Bioenergy represents a promising replacement for conventional energy, due to reduced environmental impacts and broad applicability. Sustainable energy challenges, however, require innovative manufacturing technologies and practices to mitigate energy and material consumption. This research aims to facilitate sustainable production of bioenergy from forest biomass and to promote deployment of novel processing equipment (mobile bio-refinery units). The study integrates knowledge from the renewable energy production and supply chain management disciplines to evaluate economic targets of bioenergy production with use of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The decision support system method employs two phases: (1) classification of potential biomass harvesting sites via decision tree analysis and (2) optimization of the supply network through a mixed integer linear programming model that minimizes the costs of upstream and midstream supply chain segments. While mobile units are shown to reduce biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain costs, production and deployment of the units is limited due to undeveloped bioenergy supply chains and quality uncertainty.

With the emergence of supply chain principles in today's business world, GA has increased its role in improving managerial decision-making processes and subsequently enhancing supply chain efficiency by avoiding the sub-optimisation of problem solutions. Despite its application potentials, we have seen the limited use of GA for supply chain management. To make the best use of GA for supply chain management, this paper introduces the theoretical underpinning of GA and then explains how effectively it works for solving difficult supply chain problems.

We define the architecture of SCA as the integration of three sets of resources, data management resources (DMR), IT-enabled planning resources and performance management resources (PMR), from the perspective of a resource-based view. Based on the data collected from 537 manufacturing plants, we test hypotheses exploring the relationships among these resources, supply chain planning satisfaction, and operational performance. Our analysis supports that DMR should be considered a key building block of manufacturers business analytics initiatives for supply chains. The value of data is transmitted to outcome values through increasing supply chain planning and performance capabilities. Additionally, the deployment of advanced IT-enabled planning resources occurs after acquisition of DMR. Manufacturers with sophisticated planning technologies are likely to take advantage of data-driven processes and quality control practices. DMR are found to be a stronger predictor of PMR than IT planning resources. All three sets of resources are related to supply chain planning satisfaction and operational performance.

In this study, a supply chain model comprised of three major biz entities (warehouse, remanufacturing facility and user phase) is presented. An optimal (s,S) type policy for this model is first introduced under the non-leadtime assumption and then extended to the leadtime scenario. The theoretically optimal policy is not applicable as a consequence of lacking information with regard to the failure product's return flow. In order to solve this issue, data mining within the user phase is executed and the specification of user phase information that serves to implementing the optimal policy is articulated.

An agent-based simulation approach is pursued to understand the dynamics of the biofuels SC network. The interests of three SC actors are represented: users, biorefineries, and farmers. Each actor type has a binary decision option: adoption or non-adoption of biofuels. This SC network model is characterized by distributed control, time asynchrony, and resource contention among actors, who make decisions based on incomplete knowledge and delayed information. The decision dynamics of these actors are modeled using a computational ecosystem construct. A preliminary set of coupled payoff function for each actor type and each decision is developed to represent interdependencies among SC actors. The simulation model was used to evaluate three archetypes of subsidy policy. The SC network behavior is observed in terms of fraction of actors adopting the biofuel option. The SC network shows behaviors ranging from fixed point equilibrium under no delay and perfect knowledge to periodic and chaotic oscillations. The network behavior is very sensitive to the time delay parameter that partly influences the quality of information on which actors’ decisions are based. Several regions of SC behavior are identified. In particular, a chaotic behavior was observed. The work provides a methodological basis for further development, including identification of policies to control undesirable system behaviors. © 2014, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

A major field of action in this respect is the realization of real-time monitoring means for supply chain processes including a constant comparison of the respective progress status with the planning guidelines and the best possible management of deviations and exceptions. Control towers have been named as the future tool of supply chain monitoring for quite a while. They are defined as decision-support systems merging different data streams from various subordinate levels and displaying the consolidated information at a higher level for the purpose of monitoring and control of processes while pursuing the goal of optimal process operation. Contrary to the technological constraints of the past which prevented a continuous and fully transparent real-time monitoring of supply chain processes, innovative evolving socalled Future Internet technologies enable genuine transparency and the handling of exceptions in a timely and cost-efficient manner nowadays. With the help of such technologies, newly designed and built control towers are supposed to assist actors on the planning and execution levels of their respective supply chain networks in their decision-making in case of relevant deviations or exceptions. This again raises the market acceptance of such control towers. This paper presents a novel approach to the functional principle of Future-Internet-based control tower solutions and describes the different components therein. Especially, the incorporation of manifold information sources from the Future Internet technologies for the purpose of real-time monitoring and control of supply chain processes is highlighted in the paper.

The production of bioenergy is expected to increase due to its unique advantages, such as no harmful emissions and abundance. Supply-related problems are the main obstacles precluding the increase of use of biomass (which is bulky and has low energy density) to produce bioenergy. To overcome this challenge, large-scale optimization models are needed to be solved to enable decision makers to plan, design, and manage bioenergy supply chains. Therefore, the use of effective optimization approaches is of great importance. The traditional mathematical methods (such as linear, integer, and mixed-integer programming) frequently fail to find optimal solutions for non-convex and/or large-scale models whereas metaheuristics are efficient approaches for finding near-optimal solutions that use less computational resources. This paper presents a comprehensive review by studying and analyzing the application of metaheuristics to solve bioenergy supply chain models as well as the exclusive challenges of the mathematical problems applied in the bioenergy supply chain field. The reviewed metaheuristics include: (1) population approaches, such as ant colony optimization (ACO), the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and bee colony algorithm (BCA)"; and (2) trajectory approaches, such as the tabu search (TS) and simulated annealing (SA). Based on the outcomes of this literature review, the integrated design and planning of bioenergy supply chains problem has been solved primarily by implementing the GA. The production process optimization was addressed primarily by using both the GA and PSO. The supply chain network design problem was treated by utilizing the GA and ACO. The truck and task scheduling problem was solved using the SA and the TS, where the trajectory-based methods proved to outperform the population-based methods. © 2014 by the authors;" licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."",""Ant colony optimization"; Bee colony algorithm; Bioenergy; Genetic algorithm; Logistics; Metaheuristics; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization; Renewable energy; Simulated annealing; Supply chain;" Tabu search"",""Artificial intelligence"; Biomass; Computation theory; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Logistics; Optimal systems; Optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Simulated annealing; Supply chains; Tabu search; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Bee colony algorithms; Bio-energy; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta heuristics; Mixed integer programming; Renewable energies; Supply chain network design;" Ant colony optimization""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, many companies now require that suppliers follow certain standards or codes of conduct. However, in today's complex supply chains with hundreds of sourcing locations, ongoing monitoring of compliance through audits for every supplier is hardly practical. Consequently, an information technology system is investigated as a tool to establish ongoing monitoring of suppliers based on available information with regard to the risk that suppliers breach the compliance rules defined. This paper describes work on a system that uses a Bayesian network to integrate evidence from multiple public and private data sources in order to rank suppliers dynamically.

One of the options usually considered nowadays is biomass, especially in rural areas with significant local biomass availability. This work focuses on comparing two different biomass energy exploitation systems, aiming to provide heat to a specific number of customers at a specific cost. The first system explored is producing pellets from biomass and distributing them to the final customers for use in domestic pellet boilers. The second option is building a centralised co-generation (CHP) unit that will generate electricity and heat. Electricity will be fed to the grid, whereas heat will be distributed to the customers via a district heating network. The biomass source examined is agricultural residues and the model is applied to a case study region in Greece. The analysis is performed from the viewpoint of the potential investor. Several design characteristics of both systems are optimised. In both cases the whole biomass-to-energy supply chain is modelled, both upstream and downstream of the pelleting/CHP units. The results of the case study show that both options have positive financial yield, with the pelleting plant having higher yield. However, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the pelleting plant yield is much more sensitive than that of the CHP plant, therefore constituting a riskier investment. The model presented may be used as a decision support system for potential investors willing to engage in the biomass energy field. © 2013 IAgrE."",,""Agricultural wastes"; Artificial intelligence; Biomass; Cogeneration plants; Costs; Decision support systems; District heating; Pelletizing; Risk assessment; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Bio-mass energy; Design characteristics; District heating networks; Energy supply chains; Financial yields; Generate electricity; Investment analysis; Potential investors; Investments;" Chandipura virus""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

When a facility fails, its customers may be reassigned to other operational facilities in order to avoid the high penalty costs associated with losing service.

This need is more pronounced for supply chains of companies as at least two organizations have to collaborate, communicate, and coordinate their supply chain activities effectively to adequately address environment threats and take advantage of opportunities. Strategic agility is an essential requirement for supply chains to survive in the competitive environment. Strategic agility is comprised of three dimensions — strategic sensitivity, strategic response and collective capabilities. Companies can take advantage of the advances in information technology and information systems to enhance strategic agility. This research highlights how information systems (IS) can bolster the three dimensions of strategic agility in supply chains. A normative description approach is utilized for two companies — IKEA and Kesko to analyze the role of IS in SC strategic agility. The results show that IS, such as advances in social technologies, could be utilized for enhancing strategic agility dimension of collective capabilities. IS, such as data mining systems are vital for promoting strategic sensitivity with supply chain partners downstream i.e., customers.

Moreover, the process of designing a SC and then placing inventory, to offer high service level at the lowest possible cost, across a complex SC, is not an easy task for decision makers. In this paper we use the SC representation proposed by Graves and Willems (2000), Manufacturing & Service Operations Management 2 (1), 68-83, where a SC is divided into many supplying, manufacturing, and delivering stages. Our problem is to select one resource option to perform each stage, and based on the selected options to place an amount of inventory (in-progress and on-hand) at each stage, in order to offer a satisfactory customer service level with as low as possible total supply chain cost. A resource option here represents a supplier, a manufacturing plant (production line), or a transport mode in a supplying, manufacturing, or delivering stage, respectively. We developed an approach based on ant colony optimisation (ACO) to minimise simultaneously the total supply chain cost and the products' lead time to ensure product deliveries without delays. What are new in our approach are the bi-objective function and the computational efficiency of our ACO-based approach. In addition, ACO has not been applied to solve the inventory placement problem. As a validation of the model, we: (a) describe a successful application at CIFUNSA, one of the largest iron foundry in the world, and (b) compare different CPU time instances and metrics about multi-objective optimisation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."",""Ant colony"; Meta-heuristics; Multi-objective optimisation; Safety stock placement;" Supply chain design"",""Ant colonies"; Ant colony optimisation; Customer service levels; Manufacturing plant; Meta heuristics; Safety stock placement; Service operations management; Supply chain design; Algorithms; Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Complex networks; Costs; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Product design;" Supply chains""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We present an interactive approach for obtaining cost function estimations from a decision maker. As a result of previous experiments, a knowledge-based Genetic Programming approach for rough function approximations is presented first. After that, a novel algorithm for reaching better convergence of the roughly approximated cost functions is described. Constituting the central research topic of this article, different interactive strategies for questioning a decision maker are then implemented and computationally tested. A decision support system integrating both aspects is illustrated and numerical results are presented. It is shown that the quality of computational results first depends on the quality of decision maker's answers. Second, looking at different questioning strategies in detail, cost function convergence seems to be reached faster, if decision maker statements are added to the database step- and not group-wise. © 2013 - IOS Press and the author(s).

Since SCM absorbs financial penalties associated with under-and over-estimation of demand from retailer, finding an optimal production lot size and product customisation strategy are essential to an SCM's operation.

Efficient knowledge management has been identified as one of the key requirements to achieve integrated support for lean supply chain decisions.

The objective is to facilitate the decision-making when the management faces the dilemma of implementing either a strategy of early large-scale investments to benefit from economies of scale and capacity readiness, or a flexible strategy of low volume but more frequent capacity expansions. We consider a CLSC with two sequential product-types. We study the system's response in terms of transient flows, actual/desired capacity level, capacity expansions/contractions and total supply chain profit, employing a simulation-based system dynamics optimization approach. Extensive numerical investigation covers a broad range of real-world remanufacturable products under alternative scenarios in relation to the market preference over product-types. The key findings propose flexible policies as improved alternatives to large-scale capacity expansions/contractions in terms of adaptability to the actual pattern of end-of-use product returns and involved risk in the investments' turnover. Flexible policies are also proposed as practices to avoid overcapacity phenomena in collection and remanufacturing capacity and as robust policies to product demand. Their implementation is revealed to be even more important for the case of remanufacturing, when a high capacity acquisition unit-cost ratio (remanufacturing/collection) is coupled with strong economies of scale. Finally, results under different information sharing structures show changes in remanufacturing policies, thus justifying the importance of coordination between the decision-maker and the distributor. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a solution methodology using ant colony optimisation (ACO) for a distribution-allocation problem in a two-stage supply chain with fixed cost for a transportation route. Taguchi method for robust design is adopted for finding the optimum combination of parameters of the ACO algorithm.

Realizing this scenario, this article proposes an automated system equipped with artificial intelligence to deal with these complexities and difficulties. This automated system has the capability of self-decision-making and is further complemented by the feature of reconfiguring its operation according to the various uncertainties in the Supply Chain. It utilizes multi agent architecture for its operations. It focuses on adding some additional features to the conventional multi agent architecture for improving the efficiency of the Supply chain and optimizing the make span. It exploits the ‘‘Outsourcing of operations’’ feature by its agents to conclude the manufacturing processes faster and reduce the idle time of certain machines.

In this paper, a customer trust index is designed as the trust level arising from the information sharing degree and quality, related to the information shared by a supplier with his customer. The customer trust level is evaluated using a fuzzy decision support system integrating information sharing dimensions. The core is a rule-based system designed using the results of questionnaires and interviews with supply chain experts. Several tests were generated in order to analyze the impact of the different information sharing attributes on the customer trust index. The developed approach is then applied to a real supply chain from the textile industry. Results show large differences of weight and impact between the different information-related factors that build the customer trust index. It is also shown that the proposed system has an important role in ensuring the objectivity of the trust assessment process and in helping decision makers evaluate their business partners. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The benefits can be grouped around two main concepts: firstly the optimization of operations through the development of optimal strategies for procurement and secondly the stock reduction that reduces storage costs, handling, etc. There is currently a variety of methods for making predictions, these methods vary from pure statistical methods such as exponential smoothing Holt-Winters or ARIMA models, to those based on artificial intelligence techniques like neural networks or fuzzy systems. However, despite being able to build accurate models, in managing the supply chain based on forecasts there is a problem known as """"Forrester effect"""" irrespective of the model chosen. To monitor the impact of this effect, given the volume of information handled in large corporations, is a very expensive task (often manual) for such corporations because it requires investigating issues such as the adequacy of the model, allocation of known models to the sales time series, discovery of new patterns of behavior, etc. This article proposes an intelligent system based on support vector machines to solve problems concerning the allocation and discovery of new models. With this focus in mind, the system objective is to build groups of time series that share the same forecasting model. For the identification of new models, the system will assign """"virtual models"""" for those groups that do not have a predefined pattern. Using the proposed method, it has been possible to group a sample of more than 14,000 time series (real data taken from a store) in around 70 categories, of which only 12 of them already grouped over 98% of the total. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - Two ABDS systems have been developed and evaluated. The first system concerns a manufacturing supply chain while the second concerns a service supply chain. The systems are based on actual case companies. Findings - This research shows that the benefits of ABDS systems in the supply chain context include the possibility to increase versatility of system architecture, to improve supply chain visibility, to conduct experiments and what-if analyses, to improve the understanding of the real system, and the possibility to improve communication within and between organizations in the supply chain. The barriers of ABDS systems in the supply chain context include the difficulty to access data from partners in the supply chain, the difficulty to access data on a higher level of granularity, and the difficulty to retrieve data from other information systems. Research limitations/implications - The research is explorative in nature therefore empirical data from similar and other research settings should be gathered to reinforce the validity of the findings. Practical implications - This research provides knowledge and insights on how ABDS systems may be developed and used in the supply chain context and demonstrates its main benefits and barriers.

The proposed DSS for 3PL provider selection takes into consideration flexible resource and interactions among providers. When applying multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) to selection of 3PL providers, it is difficult for decision-makers to determine the feasible solution domain under limited resources, especially if the decision problems are NP-complete. Moreover, traditional mathematical programming does not incorporate experts' evaluation of providers. This paper employs FANP to obtain experts' scores of the providers, and then integrates the scores into PFIGP to facilitate selection of a 3PL provider with flexible resources. Finally, this paper uses genetic algorithms to solve the PFIGP. An illustrative example is also given to demonstrate such DSS.

In the past several studies have targeted on finding the qualitative causal relationships that exist between various businesses and their associated attributes. This has resulted in the need for a quantitative approach for the evaluation of cost for supply chain management.

Pareto Ant Colony Optimisation (P-ACO) in order to obtain the non-dominated set of different SC designs was utilized as the guidance for designing manufacturing SC. PACO explores the solution space on the basis of applying the Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm and implementing more than one pheromone matrix, one for every objective. The SC design problem has been addressed by using Pareto Ant Colony Optimisation in which two objectives are minimised simultaneously. There were tested two ways in which the quantity of pheromones in the PM is incremented. In the SPM, the pheromone increment is a function of the two objectives, cost and time, while in MPM the pheromone matrix is divided into two pheromones, one for the cost and another one for the time. It could be concluded that the number of solutions do not depend on if the pheromone is split or is a function of the two variables because both method explore the same solution space. Although both methods explore the same solution space, the POS generated by every one is different. The POS that is generated when the pheromone matrix is split got solutions with lower time and cost than SMP because in the probabilistic decision rule a value of λ = 0.2 is used. It means that the ants preferred solution with a low cost instead of solutions with low time. The strategy of letting the best-so-far ant deposit pheromone over the PM accelerates the algorithm to get the optimal POS although the number of ants in the colony is small. An experimental example is used to test the algorithm and show the benefits of utilising two pheromone matrices and multiple ant colonies in SC optimisation problem. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER."",""Ant colony"; Meta-heuristics; Multi-objective optimisation;" Supply chain design"",""Ant colonies"; Ant colony optimisation; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Changing business environment; Customer demands; Deposit pheromone; Design problems; Low costs; Meta heuristics; Multi-objective optimisation; Optimisations; Preferred solutions; Probabilistic decisions; Product mix; Solution space; Supply chain design; Artificial intelligence; Hormones; Multiobjective optimization; Product design; Supply chains;" Algorithms""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A widely held belief exists that SD is mostly used to model problems at a strategic level, whereas DES is used at an operational/tactical level. This paper explores the application of DES and SD as decision support systems (DSS) for LSCM by looking at the nature and level of issues modelled. Peer reviewed journal papers that use these modelling approaches to study supply chains, published between 1996 and 2006 are reviewed. A total of 127 journal articles are analysed to identify the frequency with which the two simulation approaches are used as modelling tools for DSS in LSCM. Our findings suggest that DES has been used more frequently to model supply chains, with the exception of the bullwhip effect, which is mostly modelled using SD. Based on the most commonly used modelling approach, issues in LSCM are categorised into four groups: the DES domain, the SD domain, the common domain and the less common domain. The study furthermore suggests that in terms of the level of decision making involved, strategic or operational/tactical, there is no difference in the use of either DES or SD.

The effect of uncertain customer demand, production and supply lead times are studied. An optimum supply chain network is configured by combining optimization at the strategic and tactical level. A system dynamic based computer simulation model is used to validate the operations of the supply chain. The performance of the system is measured in terms of backorders and inventory level. The results and analysis indicate that fewer stockholding points and a shorter review period of demand can improve performance in this respect. In addition, a proposal for improving the performance of supply chain in terms of lower safety stocks is presented.

Although ordering decisions are made independently at different supply chain levels which involve manufactures, wholesalers, retailers and customers, the economic performance of ordering policies of supply chain members are heavily interdependent due to the supply-demand relationship among them. Based on the graphical evaluation and review technique, we first present a novel stochastic network mathematical model for order and cost distribution analysis. Further, to investigate the effects of different sub-orders on total system order and the impact of ordering cost on supply chain economic performance, sensitivity analysis models for order fluctuations and ordering cost changes are developed respectively. Finally, a detailed simulation is presented to promote a better understanding of the model approach. The models and algorithms are stylized";" however, they are applicable to complex supply chains. The strategy parameters in simulation are presented for various ordering policy settings. This leads to a decision support system for the multi-stage supply chain under various ordering policy scenarios, and will be helpful in identifying the key links in ordering networks and for designing effective strategies to improve supply chain performance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach - An intelligent DSS, namely order picking planning system (OPPS) with the adoption of case-based reasoning, is proposed to support managers in making appropriate order fulfilling decisions when an order involves cross-border activities. Similar cases in the past are retrieved and adapted in reference to the new order. A case study is then conducted to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the system. Findings - Recommendations are given to replace the objective decision-making process in cross-border supply chain with the help of the DSS. The warehouse order planning time has been reduced and useful information from past order records can be applied to solve new problems. Originality/value - With the increasing demand for material sourcing across different places, cross-border supply chain has raised the concern for manufacturers to seek lower material and rental costs. The focus on warehouse operations can increase efficiency in order delivery by considering cross-border requirements. © 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

In this paper, we present a holistic framework that supports data querying and analysis of raw datasets obtained from different RFID collection points managed by supply chains. First, the framework provides repair mechanisms to preprocess raw RFID data from readers. Second, we present a database model to capture SCM information at various abstraction levels such as items, time and locations, and then discuss the use of SQL query language to manipulate RFID databases.

To reach this goal, companies need to carefully plan supply chain management processes. Supplier selection is one of the most important strategic issues in supply chain. Supplier selection in supply chain management is a multi criteria decision making process which consists of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. By the rapid growth of outsourcing, supplier selection has gained significant importance. Customer satisfaction, and also satisfying customer requirements and priorities all depends on proper selection of suppliers. On the other hand, the complexity and importance of supplier selection decisions, makes the necessity of having a well-defined method more vivid. There are many methods in the literature which are proposed for supplier selection but each of them has certain limitations. In this paper, as there has been less attention to the importance of ever increasing electronic supply chain, we aim to provide a suppler selection method for one of the most important electronic supply chain, namely webinar. In the proposed method SOM and data mining techniques are deployed for the selection of best suppliers. © 2011 IEEE."",,""Chain management"; Customer requirements; Data mining techniques; Electronic supply; Multi criteria decision making; Qualitative criteria; Rapid growth; Reducing costs; Selection methods; Strategic issues; Supplier selection; Conformal mapping; Customer satisfaction; Data mining; Decision making; Industry; Self organizing maps;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In such cases, the design problem should be addressed in a collective manner, so that everyone's considerations are taken into account. Unfortunately, even though there is a vast body of literature on simulation optimization, which is widely used to solve the design problems encountered in practice, the existing research generally concentrates on providing a single solution that is optimized according to one or more performance measures. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining the values of several decision variables of a design problem where several decision-makers are involved, who have different preferences for the final solution. The different designers' considerations may not be all known in advance or may not be included in the simulation model, but can only be examined once a candidate solution is proposed. To cope with such difficulties, we propose a two-stage approach. It is first necessary to find a set of different enough designs that can be considered efficient in terms of performance. The solutions can afterwards be passed on to the decision-makers and the most appropriate one can be decided on according to their preferences. We use the crowding clustering genetic algorithm (CCGA) to solve the first sub-problem, where the performances of the candidate designs are evaluated using simulation. We address the second sub-problem with a multiplicative variant of the popular analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which does not suffer from the dependence on irrelevant alternatives as the original version. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed two-stage approach on a supply chain design problem. © 2011 IEEE."",""Analytic Hierarchy Process"; multimodal optimization; simulation optimization;" supply chain"",""Candidate solution"; Clustering genetic algorithms; Collaborative design; Decision makers; Decision variables; Design problems; Multi-modal optimization; Performance measure; Simulation model; Simulation optimization; Supply chain design; Two stage; Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial intelligence; Clustering algorithms; Computer simulation; Hierarchical systems; Logistics; Optimization; Supply chain management; Supply chains;" Design""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hence, throughout the planning horizon, decisions about which new assets to establish and where to increment capacity must be taken at minimal cost (or minimal risk) and in a timely manner. However, when demand varies non-monotonically, decisions about which assets to temporarily shut down in times of decreasing demand and which of those to reopen when market conditions improve must also be taken into account. In order to respond to the risky nature of commodity markets, we propose a multi-stage stochastic programming approach to deal with the capacity planning problem in a realistic Global Mining Supply Chain.

In addition to balancing the material flow to honour physical constraints (i.e. storage capacities, minimum production rates, transportation bottlenecks, etc.), the system aims to maximise the overall output of the supply chain network. Other benefits from a business point of view are the reduction of time to generate a factory plan while providing better accuracy and visibility of the material flow. Reducing the costs for creating a plan allows for what-if-scenario analysis and strategic planning which would not have been possible otherwise.

However, each SC unit in B2B-SC still individually develops their performance. Besides, their linkages of performance attributes between SC units still lack vital information extraction to improve theirs. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an integrated framework between B2B supply chain (B2B-SC) performance evaluation systems and data mining techniques, developing relationship rules of collaborative performance attribute enhancement. The methodology is as follows. Firstly, B2B-SC performance evaluation questionnaires based on two levels able to characterize collaborative relation between two or more partners in their SC were gathered from the case study companies. The data set of relationships between enterprise and its direct customers of the case study companies in France was used for demonstration. Secondly, data cleaning and preparations for rule extraction were performed on the questionnaire database. The significance of attribute was calculated using attribute ranking algorithms by means of information gain based on ranker search. These results were used to choose the crucial attributes from each micro view. Thirdly, web graph analysis was performed on this data to confirm the strong attribute relationship. Next, association rule was deployed to extract performance attribute relationship rules grounded on support and confidence cross validation method. The quality of each recognized rule is tested and, from numerous rules, only those that are statistically very strong and contain vital information are selected. Last but not least, these rules are interpreted by domain experts and studied by domain engineers to build a collaborative performance attribute enhancement road map. Furthermore, the final rule set of extracted rules contains very interesting information relating to SCs and also point out the critical existing SC attribute improvement. Ultimately, companies in this SC are able to use this framework to design and adjust their units to conform with the exact customer needs."",""Association rule"; Attribute ranking; Business to business (B2B); Data mining;" Supply chain (SC)"",""Attribute ranking"; Business to business (B2B); Collaborative performance; Collaborative relations; Cross-validation methods; Customer need; Data cleaning; Data logging systems; Data mining techniques; Data sets; Domain experts; Information Extraction; Information gain; Integrated frameworks; Interesting information; Performance attributes; Performance evaluation; Performance evaluation system; Relationship rules; Road-maps; Rule extraction; Rule set; Semi-automated; Supply chain performance; Support and confidence; Web graph analysis; Association rules; Data mining; Information management; Maps; Roads and streets; Surveys; Systems science; User interfaces;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is achieved by an efficient supply chain DSS that is optimized for delivery of platelets from production centers to transfusion centers, typically hospitals. One of the critical elements of the DSS is an embedded non-convex integer optimization model that assists the regional blood center manager to schedule the shuttle transportation of whole blood from collection sites to the regional processing center. The proposed non-convex integer model is transformed to a linear 0-1 problem using a two-step conversion process. The transformed model is successfully solved and the optimal solution is reached for the test data. An application of the integrated DSS using data from a regional blood center is described.

Thus, a distributed, autonomous approach, strong enough to face changes is necessary, which is what MASs contribute to. An agent can represent each of the components that form the SC. Then the resulting agent system will own similar characteristics to the ones in the studied SC&colon;" autonomy, social abilities, reactivity, pro-activity. FindingsWhen analysing the demand for each SC member (from manufacturer to final consumer), one can observe that while consumer demand is a relatively stable feature, the upper link in the chain (the manufacturer), presents a very pronounced variability. This is known as the """"bullwhip effect"""" or """"forrester effect"""" and is mainly due to the fact that the SC members' strategies are not considered as a whole but as a sum of individual strategies. In the proposed system, each agent will be communicated with other """"agents"""" who will be the only responsible for making forecasts based on information provided to it by all components of the chain. The ultimate goal is for each SC echelon to satisfy its own objectives, while at the same time meet the local and external constraints. Research limitations/implicationsIn this work a standard SC is proposed (one manufacturer – one distributor – one wholesaler – one retailer) although it could easily be modified to incorporate a bigger number of members in each echelon within the SC. Originality/valueThe paper shows the benefits of using artificial intelligence in the SC management. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited."",""Control systems"; Intelligent agents; Process management;" Supply chain management"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, there are no effective quantitative methods to guide the resource integration practices of enterprises and this situation will inevitably limit the practical application of 4PL and will become a major bottleneck of showing its superiorities. To solve this operational bottleneck in 4PL, this paper analyzes thoroughly the characteristics of the supply chain resource integration in 4PL mode from a quantitative view, set up an operational framework by case studies of surveyed enterprises combined with the empirical analyses of the supply chain resource integration. On this basis, this paper puts forward a decision optimization method of supply chain resource integration in 4PL based on the discovery, analyses and judgment about the dominant factors in the integration operations, then, sets up a mathematics optimization model for integration decision and an improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the decision problem. Finally, the paper uses a case simulation to illustrate that the optimization method and algorithm are feasible and valid. © 2011 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The buyer has two ordering opportunities: the one happens before the beginning of the season, and the other takes place at the end of the season. The ordered items are produced by the manufacturer in two production modes for different requirements. The first production mode is relatively cheap but requires a long lead-time, whereas the second is expensive but offers quick response. Under such a setting, the centralised and decentralised decision models are developed, respectively, and the closed form solution to each model is provided as well. Moreover, we point out that the traditional revenue-sharing contract fails to coordinate the supply chain. We thus propose an improved revenue-sharing contract that requests the manufacturer not only shares the buyer's revenue but also bears a portion of the buyer's operating costs. Such a contract can achieve perfect coordination of the supply chain and arbitrarily allocate its profit between two parties. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."",""advertising expenditure"; improved revenue-sharing contract; random demand; supply chain coordination;" two production modes"",""advertising expenditure"; Random demand; Revenue sharing contracts; supply chain coordination; two production modes; Artificial intelligence; Manufacture; Operating costs; Profitability; Supply chain management; Supply chains;" Sales""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Decentralized SCC paradigm could offer various contemporary advantages such as individual suppliers' decision right protection and overall decision efficiency enhancement. This paper proposes an optimization system, atcPortal, to practically enable such a decentralized SCC process. Individual suppliers convert their local decision support systems into decision web services to form a distributed open-standard SCC service platform, called supply chain grid (SCG) in this paper. As a decomposition-based optimization method, analytical target cascading (ATC) is the mechanism for atcPortal to coordinate these web services through three phases of service searching, service-based ATC problem definition, and service-oriented ATC execution. atcPortal is a generic and extensible web portal in the sense that ATC accommodates a variety of decentralized SCC decision structures without confining the local decision models of individual enterprises. Finally, the usage of atcPortal is demonstrated through a typical decentralized SCC problem. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved."",""Analytical target cascading"; Decentralized decision making; Supply chain configuration;" Web service"",""Analytical target cascading"; Decentralized decision making; Decentralized supply chains; Decision method; Decision right; Decomposition methods; Decomposition-based optimization; Distributed decision; Efficiency enhancement; Integrated decision; Local decisions; Optimization system; Problem definition; Service Oriented; Service platforms; Service-based; Supply chain configuration; Three phasis; Web portal; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Models; Optimization; Security of data; Supply chain management; Web services;" Supply chains""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The proposed approach consists of two major functions, mining association rules for inventory and selecting SC cost-impact rules. Initially, the association rules are mined from EMA-based inventory data, which is determined from the original historical data. Apriori, a classic data mining algorithm is utilized for mining association rules from EMA-based inventory data. Later, with the aid of genetic algorithm, SC cost-impact rules are selected for every SC member. The obtained SC cost-impact rules will possibly signify the future state of inventory in any SC member. Moreover, the level of holding or reducing the inventory can be determined from the SC cost-impact rules. Thus, the SC cost-impact rules that are derived using the proposed approach greatly facilitate optimal inventory control and hence make the supply chain management more effective."",""Data mining"; Genetic algorithm; Inventory optimization;" Supply chain management"",""Association rules"; Cost reduction; Costs; Data mining; Genetic algorithms; Inventory control; Optimization; Apriori; Control methodology; Cost impact; Data mining algorithm; Historical data; Inventory data; Inventory optimization; Mining associations;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, we considered a supply-chain (SC) system including several kinds of products. Using historic suppliers' demand data, we firstly applied the phase space analysis method and then used qualitative analysis to improve the complex system's performance. Quantitative methods can forecast the quantitative SC demands, but they cannot indicate the qualitative aspects of SC, so when we apply quantitative methods to a SC system we get only numerous data of demand. By contrast, qualitative methods can show the qualitative change and trend of the SC demand. We therefore used qualitative methods to improve the quantitative forecasting results. Comparing the quantitative only method and the combined method used in this paper, we found that the combined method is far more accurate.

One of the main aspects addressed is the replenishment process which considers demand forecasting, customer orders, inventory levels, and production and transport planning. Generally, replenishment processes are carried out traditionally by no considering sharing information among the nodes and neither by coordinating the transport planning with the production planning. With this in mind, this paper mainly focuses on proposing a novel decentralized collaborative replenishment model applied to the automobile sector in order to support the decision-making process among automobile supply chain decision-makers. This has been based on the replenishment information that is already used by supply chain members. This work hypothesizes that a collaborative replenishment process could imply a reduction in inventory levels and, in turn, in inventory costs, and that the number of trucks needed to support the replenishment process would be optimized. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press.

Costs are associated with every risk factor that causes disturbances in the allocation of certain goods at the required place and time, and with the required quality and quantity. In this paper, we consider a multi-echelon global supply chain model, where raw material suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses and markets are located in different countries. The paper first identifies all types of operational risk factors, their expected value and probability of occurrence, and associated additional cost. Based on initial information for the risk factors, optimal decisions regarding the inter-echelon quantity flow in the supply chain are made for a single planning horizon. Then, with the change in the expected value of the risk factors, the intra-echelon shift of flow is determined in order to minimise the total cost and risk factors. Considering the complexity involved with the problem, various computational intelligence techniques such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation and artificial bee colony are applied in the solution evaluation phase. The results obtained using the developed model illustrate that the ability to react to changes in risk factors offers potential solutions to robust supply chain design. © 2010 Taylor & Francis."",""Computational intelligence techniques"; Flexibility; Risk management;" Supply chain management"",""Additional costs"; Computational intelligence; Computational intelligence techniques; Developed model; Evaluation phase; Expected values; Flexibility; Global supply chain; Globalisation; Initial information; Multiechelon; Operational risks; Optimal decisions; Particle swarm optimisation; Planning horizons; Potential solutions; Probability of occurrence; Raw material suppliers; Risk factors; Supply chain costs; Supply chain design; Total costs; Artificial intelligence; Costs; Optimization; Risk management; Risks; Supply chains;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The first policy is continuous time replenishment policy where the retailers' inventory is replenished in every time interval. In the next three policies, inventory of the retailers will be replenished by some definite policy factors. The vendor managed inventory (VMI) system is used for updating the inventory of the retailers. An order-up-to policy (q, Q) is used for updating the inventory of distributors. Total erstwhile demands to the retailer will be used to determine the amount of inventory acclivity. Furthermore, the distributors will be sending the delivery vehicles to few fellow retailers who are shortlisted according to the policy, followed by the retailers and associated distributors. On the basis of random demand that the retailers are facing from end customers and the total demand that has incurred in the supply chain, products are unloaded to the selected retailers from the delivery vehicle. The path of the delivery vehicle is retrieved by dynamic ant colony optimization. In addition, a framework has been developed to measure the end-customer satisfaction level and total supply chain cost incorporating the inventory holding cost, ordering cost and the transportation cost. The framework has been numerically moulded with different settings to compare the performance of the quadruplet policies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, human beings have been found to be both surprisingly successful and disappointingly inept at managing supply chains. The related fields of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence have postulated a variety of potential mechanisms to explain this behavior. One of the leading candidates is reinforcement learning. This paper applies agent-based modeling to investigate the comparative behavioral consequences of three simple reinforcement learning algorithms in a multi-stage supply chain. For the first time, our findings show that the specific algorithm that is employed can have dramatic effects on the results obtained. Reinforcement learning is found to be valuable in multi-stage supply chains with several learning agents, as independent agents can learn to coordinate their behavior. However, learning in multi-stage supply chains using these postulated approaches from cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence take extremely long time periods to achieve stability which raises questions about their ability to explain behavior in real supply chains. The fact that it takes thousands of periods for agents to learn in this simple multi-agent setting provides new evidence that real world decision makers are unlikely to be using strict reinforcement learning in practice. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company."",""Agent-based modeling"; Reinforcement learning;" Supply chain management"",""Agent-based modeling"; Cognitive psychology; Decision makers; Effective management; Human being; Independent agents; Learning agents; Multi-agent setting; Multi-stage; Potential mechanism; Time periods; Artificial intelligence; Education; Intelligent agents; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement; Reinforcement learning; Supply chain management; Supply chains; algorithm; article; artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer simulation; decision support system; game; human; probability; reinforcement; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Decision Support Techniques; Game Theory; Humans; Markov Chains; Models, Neurological; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated;" Reinforcement (Psychology)""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Each agent works as a broker for each service type, dedicated to selecting solutions for each service as well as interacting with other agents in refining the decision making to achieve compatibility among the solutions. The coordination among agents concerns decision making at strategic, tactical, and operational level. At the strategic level, agents communicate and negotiate for supply chain formation"; at the tactical level, argumentation is used by agents to communicate and understand the preferences and constraints of each other;" at the operational level, different strategies are used for selecting the preferences. Based on this approach, a prototype has been implemented with simulated experiments highlighting the effectiveness of the approach. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These strategies are essential in guiding various activities within a supply chain such as component acquisition, inventory management, customer orders bidding, scheduling for production, and delivery. Among these activities, planning of raw material acquisition for inventory and bidding for customer orders can be extremely complex since such activities are required to deal with external entities such as suppliers and customers. Specifically, in the context of the manufacturing industry, acquiring raw materials for maintaining a flexible yet adequate inventory level is a complex issue due to the potential fluctuation in suppliers' production capacity and market demand. Designing an effective strategy for bidding customer orders is also an intricate problem due to the intense competition in fast changing market environments. In this paper, we describe the strategies of a supply chain management agent which adaptively adjusts its target inventory level and customer order bidding price based on fuzzy logic reasoning. The agent has competed in the 2006 Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain Management and has achieved good results. © 2009 - IOS Press."",""Bidding price setting"; Fuzzy logic; Intelligent agents; Supply chain management; Target inventory level;" Trading Agent Competition"",""Bidding price setting"; Bidding prices; Customer orders; Fuzzy adaptive; Fuzzy logic reasoning; Inventory levels; Inventory management; Manufacturing industries; Market demand; Market environment; Potential fluctuations; Production capacity; Technological advances; Trading Agent Competition; Artificial intelligence; Competition; Customer satisfaction; Electronic commerce; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy sets; Intelligent agents; Logistics; Mergers and acquisitions; Sales; Scheduling; Supply chains; Targets;" Supply chain management""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The approach is developed to tackle a vast array of issues, from the adaptation of an enterprise supply chain to its evolving environment, such as changing forest policies, to enterprise rationalizations through mergers or acquisitions. The methodology takes into account the specificity of the industry divergent manufacturing processes as well as the lumber market segmentation into contracts, vendor managed inventory (VMI) agreements and spot markets. The approach is based on a comprehensive two-stage stochastic programming with recourse model. A sample average approximation (SAA) method based on Monte Carlo sampling techniques is proposed to solve this stochastic program, and it is shown that this approach outperforms the use of a comparable deterministic model based on averages. Finally, the decision support system developed to implement the approach is used to show how it can contribute to dealing with strategic issues in the Eastern-Canadian lumber industry.

However, little has been done in building a context-aware data mining methodology which supports decision-making based on an enterprise supply chain finance cooperative systems. An enterprise supply chain finance cooperative system that interacts with bank, buyer and supplier environment may not have sufficient knowledge of the environment, and it is the responsibility of the environment observation units to communicate the environment context parameters to the system. Context-aware data mining is an application able to sense and analyze the context from various sources and which takes actions suited to contexts for improving performance and efficacy of decision-making by identifying the unknown factors. This paper proposes a context-aware data mining methodology for enterprise supply chain finance cooperative system for manufacturing industry. It consists of three main components. The first component is the model for enterprise supply chain finance cooperative systems with cooperative agents serving as the representatives of bank, buyer, supplier communicating with each other over the company's network. In the second component, context-aware data mining framework is proposed based on the architecture for the enterprise supply chain finance cooperative systems.

Supply chain sustainability, which includes designing green supply chains, will gain much more attention in the future. Indeed, most companies are still in the early stage of considering a green initiative. Traditionally, optimization models for supply chain network design looked to different strategic network alternatives, and analyze the trade-offs between logistics costs and service requirements. Today, with the strong emphasis in reducing greenhouse gas footprint, the integration of such consideration into the supply chain network design phase will provide to companies much more visibility on how to manage efficient, effective, and green supply chains. In this paper, a mathematical programming model for environmental conscious supply chain network design is introduced with the explicit inclusion of carbon emission cost. By considering the greenhouse gases emissions cost together with traditional logistics costs, the problem is formulated as a single objective optimization program. The methodology uses mixed integer linear programming modeling technique to deal with different strategic decisions, including supplier and subcontractor selection, product allocation, capacity utilization, and assignment of transportation links required to satisfy market demand. This new formulation provides decision makers with a quantitative decision support system to understand the tradeoffs between the total logistics cost and the carbon footprint reduction."",""CO2 emission"; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission; Mixed integer programming; Network design;" Supply chain management"",""Capacity utilization"; Carbon emissions; Decision makers; Environmental problems; Green supply chain; Greenhouse gases emissions; Integrated logistics; Logistics costs; Market demand; Mathematical programming models; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer programming; Modeling technique; Network design; Optimization models; Product allocations; Quantitative decision; Reverse logistics; Service requirements; Single objective optimization; Strategic decisions; Supply chain network design; Total logistics costs; Transportation links; Artificial intelligence; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Commerce; Costs; Decision support systems; Design; Environmental impact; Industry; Information systems; Logistics; Mathematical programming; Operations research; Supply chain management; Waste management;" Greenhouse gases""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(Wittgenstein) Supply Chain Management (SCM) deals with the management of flows of goods, funds and information within and between supply chain partners in order to satisfy consumer needs in the most efficient way (Christopher, 1998). Information is one of the biggest drivers of supply chain performance. The concept of Supply Chain Controlling (SCC) aims at supporting SCM by providing accurate information to the right manager at the right time for supply chain wide optimal decision making. Consequently, information from different sources must be integrated in order to set up a supply-chain-wide decision support system (DSS). However, there is hardly any method available that provides guidelines for the requirements specification for SCC.

One of the crucial determinants of effective supply chain management is the ability to recognize customer demand patterns and react accordingly to the changes in face of intense competition. Thus the ability to adequately predict demand by the participants in a supply chain is vital to the survival of businesses. Demand prediction is aggravated by the fact that communication patterns between participants that emerge in a supply chain tend to distort the original consumer's demand and create high levels of noise. Distortion and noise negatively impact forecast quality of the participants. This work investigates the applicability of machine learning (ML) techniques and compares their performances with the more traditional methods in order to improve demand forecast accuracy in supply chains. To this end we used two data sets from particular companies (chocolate manufacturer and toner cartridge manufacturer), as well as data from the Statistics Canada manufacturing survey. A representative set of traditional and ML-based forecasting techniques have been applied to the demand data and the accuracy of the methods was compared. As a group, Machine Learning techniques outperformed traditional techniques in terms of overall average, but not in terms of overall ranking. We also found that a support vector machine (SVM) trained on multiple demand series produced the most accurate forecasts. © 2009, IGI Global."",,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this problem, a single wholesaler with multiple retailer customers must find an optimal balance of quantities ordered from suppliers and acceptable lead time costs, while taking into account limiting factors such as the time each retailer will wait for a backorder. The following four evolutionary computations (EC) are utilized to find a solution: evolutionary programming (EP), genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimizers (PSO), and estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA). In addition, problem-specific modifications to each are created. Of the 32 attempted algorithms, the following proved to be best with respect to the client-mandated test-suite: Probabilistic Dual-Topology Full-Model PSO, Star-Topology Full-Model PSO using dynamically-adjusting learning rates, Out-of-the-Box Star-Topology Full-Model PSO, and a Gaussian-based Star-Topology Full-Model PSO with the Constriction Coefficient.

Supply chain finance is often necessary to analyze large data sets, maintained over geographically bank, supplier and customer distributed sites by using cooperative context-aware distributed data mining (DDM) systems. The study of the existing approaches shows that no single solution fulfills all requirements identified for the cooperative context-aware DDM systems. One of the basic obstacles is the lack of context-aware and supporting some of the computational resources - such as data and information bases, computational models, compute power to execute these models, specialized data mining algorithms - required to develop a new compound is not available locally, but accessible via the global computing network infrastructure. This paper proposes a multi-agent-based architecture for supply chain finance cooperative distributed data mining systems. The use of multi-agent-systems (MAS) creates a framework which allows the inter-operation of a vast set of heterogeneous solutions to carry out the complex supply chain finance context-aware distributed data mining tasks, many data mining tasks to connect heterogeneous resources, as data sources, processing nodes and end user applications.

Computational results show that in such stochastic supply chains, IIM performs about 23, 15, and 3% better than the optimised RMI, VMI-1 and VMI-2 policies, respectively, while two VMI policies are about 8 and 20% better than the best RMI.

In this paper we investigate the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques, including neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and support vector machines, to forecasting distorted demand at the end of a supply chain (bullwhip effect). We compare these methods with other, more traditional ones, including naïve forecasting, trend, moving average, and linear regression. We use two data sets for our experiments: one obtained from the simulated supply chain, and another one from actual Canadian Foundries orders.

Agroindustry is defined as an enterprise that transforms agricultural products (plant, marine and aquatic, livestock, and forestry) into industrial products in order to gain their added value. Each different step in the entire production process, from the farming of basic raw materials to delivery of final products to consumer, is viewed as link in the chain of agroindustrial systems. Agroindustrial Supply Chain Management (Agro-SCM), therefore, represents the management of the entire set of production, manufacturing/transformations, distribution and marketing activities by which a consumer is supplied with a desired product. The objective of this research is to develop an integrated decision support system consisting of a new multi-objective genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic for optimization of supply chain of bio-diesel industry, an important agroindustry in Indonesia. Supply chain improvements will reduce inventories, waste and costs, and thus increase efficiency within the bio-diesel industry and the market channel. The mathematical model for supply chain management developed in this research attempts to capture the dynamics of a single product being produced from coconut or palm oil. There are j coconut or palm oil farming (suppliers), k bio-diesel industry and l customer demands. Coconut or palm oil can be supplied by any of the j farming. This raw material can be shipped to any of the k bio-diesel industry where the product is made. Then they are shipped to customers based on demands. The multiple objectives used in this research are minimizing Total Supply Chain Cost (TSCC) and minimizing Expected Number of Deteriorated Product (ENDP). The second objective is essential for agroindustry. The variables to be optimized are the amount of coconut or palm oil from suppliers to plants, the amount of bio-diesel shipped from plants to customer zone and the inventories in the plants.

Software agents combine and integrate capabilities of several information technology classes in a novel manner that enables supply chain management and decision making in modes not supported previously by IT and not reported previously in the information systems literature. Indeed, federations and swarms of software agents today are moving the boundaries of computer-aided decision making more generally. Such moving boundaries highlight promising new opportunities for competitive advantage in business, in addition to novel theoretical insights. But they also call for shifting research thrusts in information systems. The stream of research associated with this article is taking some first steps to address such issues by examining experimentally the capabilities, limitations, and boundaries of agent technology for computer-based decision support and automation in the procurement domain. Procurement represents an area of particular potential for agent-based process innovation, as well as reflecting some of the greatest technological advances in terms of agents emerging from the laboratory. Procurement is imbued with considerable ambiguity in its task environment, ambiguity that presents a fundamental limitation to IT-based automation of decision making and knowledge work. By investigating the comparative performance of human and software agents across varying levels of ambiguity in the procurement domain, the experimentation described in this article helps to elucidate some new boundaries of computer-based decision making quite broadly. We seek in particular to learn from this domain and to help inform computer-based decision making, agent technological design, and IS research more generally."",""Agents"; Artificial intelligence; Behavioral decision theory; Computer-aided decision making; Human performance; Procurement;" supply chain management"",""Artificial intelligence"; Computer aided engineering; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information technology; Behavioral decision theory; Computer-aided decision making; Human performance; Procurement; Supply chain management;" Software agents""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Exceptions occur frequently in supply-chains and mostly result in severe monetary losses. Consequently, detecting exceptions timely is of great practical value. Traditional approaches have aimed at detecting exceptions after they have occurred. Whereas this is important, predicting exceptions before they happen is of more importance, since it can ease the handling of exceptions. Accordingly, this paper develops a commitment-based approach for modeling and predicting exceptions. The participants of the supply-chains are represented as autonomous agents. Their communication with other agents yields creation and manipulation of commitments. Violation of commitments leads to exceptions. We develop two methods for detecting such violations. The first method uses an AND/OR tree to analyze situations in small parts. The second method uses an ontology to generate new information about the environment and checks whether this information may cause any violations. When applied together, these methods can predict exceptions in supply-chain scenarios. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006."",,""Artificial intelligence"; Computer science; Computer simulation; Data handling; Information analysis; Trees (mathematics); Agent-based supply-chains; Exceptions; Supply-chains; Violations;" Autonomous agents""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Besides, learning consists of adapting the local behavior of each entity with the aim of optimizing a given global behavior. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used at the local level, while generalization of Q-neural algorithm is used to optimize the global behavior. The framework is implemented over an agent platform.

We present a simple model of supply chains, highlighting two characteristic features: hierarchical subtask decomposition, and resource contention. To decentralize the formation process, we introduce a market price system over the resources produced along the chain. In a competitive equilibrium for this system, agents choose locally optimal allocations with respect to prices, and outcomes are optimal overall. To determine prices, we define a market protocol based on distributed, progressive auctions, and myopic, non-strategic agent bidding policies. In the presence of resource contention, this protocol produces better solutions than the greedy protocols common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature. The protocol often converges to high-value supply chains, and when competitive equilibria exist, typically to approximate competitive equilibria. However, complementarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their outputs.

But the evaluation process is complex. The data that must be considered are both technical and social/organizational. Much of the data are difficult to obtain and ambiguous or vague to interpret. In addition, the dynamic global environment of changing exchange rates, economic conditions, and technical infrastructure, demand that the pool of potential suppliers be re-evaluated periodically. Nonetheless, a rational process of evaluation must exist to select the most appropriate suppliers. This paper addresses one dimension of the evaluation process, the information sharing capability of potential supply chain partners. It is an especially important dimension since information technology is necessary to horizontally integrate geographically dispersed operations. Fuzzy logic, a subset of artificial intelligence, together with analytical hierarchy process is used to model this process and rank potential suppliers. It is an appropriate methodology to use for this application and has the potential to be used with other supply chain design decisions since it explicitly handles vague, ambiguous, and imprecise data. © MCB UP Ltd."",""Analytical hierarchy process"; Fuzzy logic; Information;" Supply-chain management"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The difficult problem of designing negotiation strategies is greatly simplified if the negotiation mechanism is incentive compatible, in which case the agents' dominant strategy is to simply report their private information truthfully. Unfortunately, with two-sided negotiation it is impossible to simultaneously achieve perfect efficiency, budget balance, and individual rationality with incentive compatibility. This bears directly on the mechanism design problem for supply chain formation - the problem of designing auctions to coordinate the buying and selling of goods in multiple markets across a supply chain. We introduce incentive compatible, budget balanced, and individually rational auctions for supply chain formation inspired by previous work of Babaioff and Nisan, but extended to a broader class of supply chain topologies. The auctions explicitly discard profitable trades, thus giving up perfect efficiency to maintain budget balance and individual rationality. We use a novel payment rule analogous to Vickrey-Clarke-Groves payments, but adapted to our allocation rule. The first auction we present is incentive compatible when each agent desires only a single bundle of goods, the auction correctly knows all agents' bundles of interest, but the monetary valuations are private to the agents. We introduce extensions to maintain incentive compatibility when the auction does not know the agents' bundles of interest. We establish a good worst case bound on efficiency when the bundles of interest are known, which also applies in some cases when the bundles are not known. Our auctions produce higher efficiency for a broader class of supply chains than any other incentive compatible, individually rational, and budget-balanced auction we are aware of."",""Auctions"; Mechanism design;" Supply chain formation"",""Automation"; Economics; Electronic commerce; Multi agent systems; Problem solving; Auctions; Negotiation; Payment schemes; Supply chain formation;" Artificial intelligence""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It allows an inventory order policy to be determined, which is aimed at optimizing the performance of the whole supply chain. The approach consists of three techniques: (i) Markov decision processes (MDP) and (ii) an artificial intelligent algorithm to solve MDPs, which is based on (iii) simulation modeling. In particular, the inventory problem is modeled as an MDP and a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is used to determine a near optimal inventory policy under an average reward criterion.

Sequential patterns mining from large business database is a hot topic in database system and modern business management. Previous work was focused on searching efficient algorithms of mining sequential patterns. Since most of the algorithms need to scan the database for many times, this cannot be resisted because the size of the database is often very large. In the paper, we first gave the modeling description of distribution stage in supply chain, then discussed the necessary of the sequential patters mining, lastly introduced an effective algorithm in the solution of mining sequential patterns."",,""Algorithms"; Data mining; Linear programming; Production control; Scheduling; Supply chains;" Database systems""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As for any other business-related process, cash flow is equally vital to identify and manage. Perhaps less obvious is the development of tools enabling the exchange of data between the extended participants of the supply chain. This paper discusses some of the challenges of ensuring that the increasing amounts of data are both relevant and current, resulting in valuable information for the participants. These challenges include understanding business process changes, capturing relevant data, and providing information for monitoring, decision support and optimization.

In this research, collaborative and event-driven Supply Chain Information System (SCIS) is developed by using the mobile object technology. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is applied to analyze and design the SCIS Framework which contains two major components: Information Coordinator Component (ICC) and Agent Component (AC). The ICC acts as the information integration manager. It manages all the ACs and establishes proper event channels for them to exchange information. Each member within the supply chain needs to possess an AC such that it can utilize the SCIS to exchange information with the other members. An application example is constructed and its corresponding system integration and testing procedure is demonstrated. From this demonstration result, it is believed that this SCIS Framework provides a collaborative, event-driven, object-oriented, and agent-based infrastructure for the supply chain members to mutually exchange information efficiently."",,""Artificial intelligence"; Computer simulation languages; Distributed computer systems; Groupware; Industrial applications; Information technology; Mobile robots; Object oriented programming; Agent component; Information coordinator component; Mobile object technology; Supply chain information system; Unified modeling language;" Software engineering""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is essential to perform risk-benefit analysis of reengineering alternatives before making a final decision. Simulation provides an effective pragmatic approach to detailed analysis and evaluation of supply chain design and management alternatives. However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains. It provides a reusable base of domain-specific primitives that enables rapid development of customized decision support tools."",""And supply chain management"; Artificial intelligence; Decision support system;" Simulation"",";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

An order fulfillment process starts with receiving orders from customers and ends with delivery of the finished goods. As manufacturing practice is shifting toward the out-sourcing paradigm, the OFP is more likely to be executed throughout SCNs. It becomes imperative to integrate the OFP into SCNs to improve the OFP. The proposed multi-agent information system (MAIS) approach is used for modeling the OFP in SCNs, and evaluating OFP performance by applying the proposed strategies. The objective of reengineering the OFP is to achieve agility of the process in terms of efficiency, flexibility, robustness and adaptability. A multi-agent simulation platform, called Swarm, is enhanced and applied for modeling the MAIS, and experiments are conducted to simulate the OFP in SCNs in a multi-agent environment. Based on the Swarm simulation platform, we model the OFP in SCNs, simulate the OFP, and then evaluate the potential OFP improvement strategies to identify useful strategies for improving the OFP. The results shed lights on identifying the main effects of various strategies on OFP performance. The insights of utilizing various strategies in different SCNs help redesign the OFP in SCNs."",,""Computer networks"; Computer simulation; Management information systems; Multi agent information systems (MAIS); Order fulfillment process (OFP); Supply chain networks (SCN);" Artificial intelligence""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
