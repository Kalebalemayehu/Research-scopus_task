To achieve this aim, researchers have developed techniques that determine the occurrence of operational risk events which assists supply chain operational risk managers develop plans to manage them by detection/monitoring, mitigation/management, or optimization techniques. Various artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been used to develop such techniques in the broad activities of operational risk management. However, all of these techniques are black box in their working nature. This means that the chosen technique cannot explain why it has given that output and whether it is correct and free from bias. To address this, researchers argue the need for supply chain management professionals to move towards using explainable AI methods for operational risk management. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review on the techniques used to determine operational risks and analyse whether they satisfy the requirement of them being explainable. The findings highlight the shortcomings and inspires directions for future research. From a managerial perspective, the paper encourages risk managers to choose techniques for supply chain operational risk management that can be auditable as this will ensure that the risk managers know why they should take a particular risk management action rather than just what they should do to manage the operational risks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Big data; Explainable AI (XAI); Supply chain operational risk management (SCORM)","Artificial intelligence; Managers; Risk management; Supply chain management; Artificial intelligence; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Management techniques; Operational risk managements; Operational risks; Optimization techniques; Risk manager; Supply chain operation; Supply chain operational risk management; Systematic literature review; Big data","Nimmy, S.F.; School of Business, Australia; email: s.nimmy@adfa.edu.au",,"Elsevier B.V.",09507051,,KNSYE,,"English","Knowl Based Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118479625

It is important how to identify these disruptions and risks to avoid them, therefore many risk mitigation strategies have been developed. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool to identify and predict the occurrence of risks, it is also important that the solutions to avoiding risks must be explainable for risk managers. Recently, making transparent and explainable AI models has been the focus of a large number of research studies and many post-hoc algorithms such as counter-factual explanation (CE) algorithms have been developed. In this paper, first we propose an optimization problem to design a transportation schedule for the supply chain network (SCN), then to increase the resiliency and transparency of the designed schedule, the CE model is integrated into the model as a set of constraints. To design the CE, a logistic regression model is developed. The CE helps to plan the transportation schedule to avoid any transportation delay risk. The integrated CE and SCM model is used as a recommender system for risk managers to mitigate risk to the system. Finally, to validate the recommender system, a real case study is analyzed and the solutions of the model with and without the CE are compared and it is shown that the CE-added constraints increase the resiliency of the system significantly while the increase in financial cost is less than 1%. Therefore, the model is validated for use for different risks and disruptions. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Counterfactual explanation; Recommender system; Resiliency; Supply chain management","Intelligent systems; Managers; Regression analysis; Supply chain management; Counterfactual explanation; Counterfactuals; Intelligence models; Logistic Regression modeling; Optimization problems; Research studies; Resiliency; Risk manager; Risk mitigation strategy; Supply chain network; Recommender systems","Ordibazar, A.H.; School of Business, Australia; email: a.ordibazar@adfa.edu.au","Hacid H.Aldwairi M.Bouadjenek M.R.Petrocchi M.Faci N.Outay F.Beheshti A.Thamsen L.Dong H.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",03029743,9783031141348,,,"English","Lect.

This study proposes designing and developing a Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) model for market understanding, which encodes a human-like approach to explain demand and supply events for decision makers. A framework for generating reasonable descriptions in Agricultural Supply Chains (ASCs) management is proposed. The qualitative and quantitative design of the CBNs model is developed and proved that the CBNs model can reasonably explain events using predictive performance measurement and sensitivity analysis for producing reasonable descriptions.

This is particularly critical for fresh food products, due to their perishable and fragile nature, which makes the coordination of the actors all the more crucial to avoid wastes and losses. The rise of new technologies, referred to as “Industry 4.0” powered by the internet of things, big data analytics and artificial intelligence, could bring new solutions to meet these needs. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) allow for frequent exchanges of huge amounts of information between actors in the agrofood chains to coordinate their activities. The aim of the chapter is to provide a state-of-the-art analysis on ICTs used in agrofood supply chains, with a special focus on the case of fresh fruits and vegetables, to analyze the potential and weaknesses which exist in different forms of supply chains for ICTs becoming a “resource” (precious, rare, non-imitable, and nonsubstitutable) prospect and to suggest promising ICTs in this context. © 2021 by the authors.

These risks, such as drastic changes in demand, machine failures, or systems not properly configured, can lead to planning or execution issues in the supply chain. It is too expensive to have planners continually track all situations at a granular level to ensure that no deviations or configuration problems occur. We present a machine learning system that predicts service-level failures a few weeks in advance and alerts the planners. The system includes a user interface that explains the alerts and helps to identify failure fixes. We conducted this research in cooperation with Michelin. Through experiments carried out over the course of four phases, we confirmed that machine learning can help predict service-level failures. In our last experiment, planners were able to use these predictions to make adjustments on tires for which failures were predicted, resulting in an improvement in the service level of 10 percentage points. Additionally, the system enabled planners to identify recurrent issues in their supply chain, such as safety-stock computation problems, impacting the overall supply chain efficiency. The proposed system showcases the importance of reducing the silos in supply chain management.

Random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression were applied as classifiers, and the outputs were compared. The proposed model exceeded an F1 score of 80%, and we found that conditional probabilities have resulted in the highest significance.

E-commerce channel (e-channel) has become an important retail channel. The multi-period closed-loop supply chain network of electronic channels (E-CLSCN) is studied. Moreover, this study considers the influence of consumers' preference for products and artificial intelligence push (AI-push) on network balance under the conditions of dynamic and static. The network consists of manufacturers, remanufacturers, and demandmarkets. Remanufacturers are responsible for collecting andremanufacturing. Themulti-period E-CLSCN model is established through variational inequalities. The study finds that whether dynamic or static, consumers' preference for new products (NP) has positively correlated with the profits of manufacturers and the whole E-CLSCN. Consumers' preference for remanufacturer products (RP) has only positively correlated with the profits of remanufactures. In the aspect of AI-push, the manufacturers' AI-push has positively correlated with the profits of the entire players of E-CLSCN, while the remanufacturers'AI-push has only positively correlatedwith the profits of the remanufacturers. Also, considering the multi-period, the sensitivity of the demand markets for the investment of manufacturers' and remanufacturers' AI-push gradually reduces, and the marginal benefit of AI-push gradually decreases. Finally, this paper addresses interesting managerial insights from the perspective of government and enterprises. Under the dual objectives of environmental protection and economic interests of enterprises, this study provides a reference for governments and enterprises to develop relevant dynamic policies. Namely, the government formulates dynamic environmental protection measures, and enterprises formulate dynamic strategic plans and implement government policies. While promoting the management level of E-CLSCN, it effectively boosts the development of the remanufacturing industry and recycling sustainable economy. © 2019 by the authors.","AI-push; Consumers' preference for products; E-commerce channel (e-channel); Multi-period e-channel closed-loop supply chain network (E-CLSCN); Sustainable development","artificial intelligence; consumption behavior; environmental protection; governance approach; industrial policy; Internet; manufacturing; policy implementation; recycling; resource use; retailing; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; supply chain management; sustainable development","Yao, F.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: yao_fengmin@163.com",,"MDPI",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071984297

Formal verification approach becomes more interesting choice as the preventive checking of the safety and correctness of a real-time system specification from the very beginning of the design phase. In practice, a timed Petri net as a formal model is commonly used to graphically illustrate the time dependent behaviors of a real-time system. However, the simulation of the timed Petri net is tedious and inefficient for verifying the huge and complex realtime system. Alternatively, Event-B formalization approach provides an efficient and better automatic proving tool, whilst the writing Event-B specification from scratch needs the designer with the mathematical logic backgrounds. In this paper, we still encourage the drawing of an ordinary timed Petri net (OTPN) as a formal model of the supply chain events which is easier and more understandable in the first place. Moreover, we expect that several basic supply chain event patterns, as building blocks of ordinary timed Petri net notations, would help ease the construction of the formal model of the complex production processes. We hereafter propose a mean to transform the given ordinary timed Petri net of the supply chain event patterns into a complete Event-B specification which will be automatically proved by an Event-B prover called Rodin. © 2018 IEEE.","Basic supply chain patterns; Event-B; Formal Verification; Timed Petri nets","Artificial intelligence; Formal verification; Interactive computer systems; Petri nets; Real time systems; Safety engineering; Scheduling algorithms; Specifications; Basic supply chain patterns; Business process model; Complex production; Complex real-time systems; Event-B; Supply chain operation; Time dependent behavior; Timed Petri Net; Supply chains",,"Hwang H.J.Cai L.Yeom G.H.Matsuo T.Kim H.K.Yeo H.Hong C.S.Fukuta N.Ito T.Miao H.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538658895,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE/ACIS Int.

However, the risk management process is highly complex because of the stochastic and dynamic nature and ever growing complexity of supply chains. As the ultimate goal of most enterprises is generating and increasing revenues on the long run, it is valuable to know the effect of specific supply chain risk positions and risk management practices on company sales. In this paper, secondary data on supply chain risk is analyzed and the key risk management strategies responsible for increased company sales are revealed. The novelty of this paper lies in developing a quantifying data mining approach to provide a comprehensive understanding of supply chain risk management (SCRM) and pinpoint focus areas for revenue seeking enterprises. The results prove and showcase that our methodology is capable of providing actionable insights, which were previously unknown or unaddressed. © 2017 IEEE.","Association rule mining; Supply chain management; Supply chain risk positions and risk management practices","Big data; Data mining; Risk assessment; Risk management; Sales; Stochastic systems; Association analysis; Business practitioners; Risk management practices; Risk management process; Risk management strategies; Supply chain risk management; Supply chain risk management (SCRM); Supply-chain disruptions; Supply chain management",,"Nie J.-Y.Obradovic Z.Suzumura T.Ghosh R.Nambiar R.Wang C.Zang H.Baeza-Yates R.Baeza-Yates R.Hu X.Kepner J.Cuzzocrea A.Tang J.Toyoda M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538627143,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

As SCRM can be responsible for loss or gain of profit, the ultimate goal of enterprises is to have resilient supply chains with automated decision making that can deal with potential disruptions. In response to these, taking advantage of ICT developments such as knowledge and data discovery techniques and automated risk management frameworks have become a vital aspect for assuring business success. Having this context, this research has the following aims: 1) to perform literature review on identifying and categorising several types of supply chain risks in order to analyze their management strategies, 2) to perform a literature review on knowledge management frameworks and 3) to propose a knowledge management and a risk management framework that would be, at a further stage of this research, integrated in an agent based decision support system for supply chain risk management.

Due to global business competition, suppliers are required to supply raw materials with the right quality and quantity. Suppliers are responsible for reducing the inventory costs and improving product quality. This paper deals with the development of a decision support system based on the integration of analytical hierarchy process and gray relational analysis for supplier selection. The additive normalization method is used as the prioritization method to calculate the priority vector. The analysis results indicate that the proposed selection model enables the manager to select the SCPM of Notebook PC more objectively by allowing them to deploy effectively. The proposed model can also be applied to other high technology factories, thus enhancing Taiwanese competitive advantage .

Design/methodology/approachNowadays, the company must develop its activity in an environment characterized by&colon; globalization, hard competitiveness, the necessity of flexibility and of answering dynamically to a changing demand. Thus, a distributed, autonomous approach, strong enough to face changes is necessary, which is what MASs contribute to. An agent can represent each of the components that form the SC. Then the resulting agent system will own similar characteristics to the ones in the studied SC&colon; autonomy, social abilities, reactivity, pro-activity. FindingsWhen analysing the demand for each SC member (from manufacturer to final consumer), one can observe that while consumer demand is a relatively stable feature, the upper link in the chain (the manufacturer), presents a very pronounced variability. This is known as the ""bullwhip effect"" or ""forrester effect"" and is mainly due to the fact that the SC members' strategies are not considered as a whole but as a sum of individual strategies. In the proposed system, each agent will be communicated with other ""agents"" who will be the only responsible for making forecasts based on information provided to it by all components of the chain. The ultimate goal is for each SC echelon to satisfy its own objectives, while at the same time meet the local and external constraints. Research limitations/implicationsIn this work a standard SC is proposed (one manufacturer – one distributor – one wholesaler – one retailer) although it could easily be modified to incorporate a bigger number of members in each echelon within the SC.

They will be charged by the total recycling costs which leads to higher lifecycle costs of their products. Therefore, a close cooperation with recycling companies and their integration in producers supply chains, e.g. as suppliers of spare parts and secondary raw materials, will be necessary and leads to so called ""closed-loop supply chains"". A cost-efficient management of material flows between suppliers, producers, customers and recycling companies requires an integrated information management as well as advanced planning systems.
